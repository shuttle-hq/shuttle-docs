## Raise an Issue

Raising [issues](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues) is encouraged.
## Docs

If you found an error in our docs, or you simply want to make them better, contributions to our [docs](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-docs)
are always appreciated!

## Running Locally
You can use Docker and docker-compose to test shuttle locally during development. See the [Docker install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
and [docker-compose install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) instructions if you do not have them installed already.

> Note for Windows: The current [Makefile](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/blob/main/Makefile) does not work on Windows systems by itself - if you want to build the local environment on Windows you could use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Additional Windows considerations are listed at the bottom of this page.

> Note for Linux: When building on Linux systems, if the error unknown flag: --build-arg is received, install the docker-buildx package using the package management tool for your particular system.

Clone the shuttle repository (or your fork):

```
git clone git@github.com:shuttle-hq/shuttle.git
cd shuttle
```

You should now be ready to setup a local environment to test code changes to core `shuttle` packages as follows:

From the root of the shuttle repo, build the required images with:

```bash
make images
```

The images get built with [cargo-chef](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef) and therefore support incremental builds (most of the time). So they will be much faster to re-build after an incremental change in your code - should you wish to deploy it locally straight away.

You can now start a local deployment of shuttle and the required containers with:

```bash
make up
```

> Note: Other useful commands can be found within the [Makefile](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/blob/main/Makefile).

The API is now accessible on `localhost:8000` (for app proxies) and `localhost:8001` (for the control plane). When running `cargo run --bin cargo-shuttle` (in a debug build), the CLI will point itself to `localhost` for its API calls.

In order to test local changes to the library crates, you may want to add the below to a `.cargo/config.toml` file. (See [Overriding Dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html) for more)

``` toml
[patch.crates-io]
shuttle-service = { path = "[base]/shuttle/service" }
shuttle-common = { path = "[base]/shuttle/common" }
shuttle-proto = { path = "[base]/shuttle/proto" }
shuttle-aws-rds = { path = "[base]/shuttle/resources/aws-rds" }
shuttle-persist = { path = "[base]/shuttle/resources/persist" }
shuttle-shared-db = { path = "[base]/shuttle/resources/shared-db" }
shuttle-secrets = { path = "[base]/shuttle/resources/secrets" }
shuttle-static-folder = { path = "[base]/shuttle/resources/static-folder" }
```

Before we can login to our local instance of shuttle, we need to create a user.
The following command inserts a user into the gateway state with admin privileges:

```bash
docker compose --file docker-compose.rendered.yml --project-name shuttle-dev exec auth /usr/local/bin/service --state=/var/lib/shuttle-auth init --name admin --key test-key
```

Login to shuttle service in a new terminal window from the root of the shuttle directory:

```bash
cargo run --bin cargo-shuttle -- login --api-key "test-key"
```

The [shuttle examples](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/examples) are linked to the main repo as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), to initialize it run the following commands:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then `cd` into any example:

```bash
cd examples/rocket/hello-world/
```

Create a new project, this will prompt your local instance of the gateway to
start a deployer container:

```bash
# the --manifest-path is used to locate the root of the shuttle workspace
cargo run --manifest-path ../../../Cargo.toml --bin cargo-shuttle -- project new
```

Deploy the example:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path ../../../Cargo.toml --bin cargo-shuttle -- deploy
```

Test if the deployment is working:

```bash
# the Host header should match the Host from the deploy output
curl --header "Host: {app}.unstable.shuttleapp.rs" localhost:8000/hello
```

View logs from the current deployment:

```bash
# append `--follow` to this command for a live feed of logs
cargo run --manifest-path ../../../Cargo.toml --bin cargo-shuttle -- logs
```

### Testing deployer only

The steps outlined above starts all the services used by shuttle locally (ie. both `gateway` and `deployer`). However, sometimes you will want to quickly test changes to `deployer` only. To do this replace `make up` with the following:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.rendered.yml up provisioner
```

This prevents `gateway` from starting up. Now you can start deployer only using:

```bash
provisioner_address=$(docker inspect --format '{{(index .NetworkSettings.Networks "shuttle_default").IPAddress}}' shuttle_prod_hello-world-rocket-app_run)
cargo run -p shuttle-deployer -- --provisioner-address $provisioner_address --provisioner-port 8000 --proxy-fqdn local.rs --admin-secret test-key --project <project_name>
```

The `--admin-secret` can safely be changed to your api-key to make testing easier. While `<project_name>` needs to match the name of the project that will be deployed to this deployer. This is the `Cargo.toml` or `Shuttle.toml` name for the project.

### Using Podman instead of Docker

If you are using Podman over Docker, then expose a rootless socket of Podman using the following command:

```bash
podman system service --time=0 unix:///tmp/podman.sock
```

Now make docker-compose use this socket by setting the following environment variable:

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///tmp/podman.sock
```

shuttle can now be run locally using the steps shown earlier.

> Note: Testing the `gateway` with a rootless Podman does not work since Podman does not allow access to the `deployer` containers via IP address!

## Running Tests

shuttle has reasonable test coverage - and we are working on improving this
every day. We encourage PRs to come with tests. If you're not sure about
what a test should look like, feel free to [get in touch](https://discord.gg/shuttle).

To run the unit tests for a specific crate, from the root of the repository run:

```bash
# replace <crate-name> with the name of the crate to test, e.g. `shuttle-common`
cargo test --package <crate-name> --all-features --lib -- --nocapture
```

To run the integration tests for a spesific crate (if it has any), from the root of the repository run:

```bash
# replace <crate-name> with the name of the crate to test, e.g. `cargo-shuttle`
cargo test --package <crate-name> --all-features --test '*' -- --nocapture
```

To run the end-to-end tests, from the root of the repository run:

```bash
make test
```

> Note: Running all the end-to-end tests may take a long time, so it is recommended to run individual tests shipped as part of each crate in the workspace first.

## Committing

We use the [Angular Commit Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit). We expect all commits to conform to these guidelines.

We will squash commits before merging to main. If you do want to squash commits, please do not do so
after the review process has started, the commit history can be useful for reviewers.

Before committing:
- Make sure your commits don't trigger any warnings from Clippy by running: `cargo clippy --tests --all-targets`. If you have a good reason to contradict Clippy, insert an `#[allow(clippy::<lint>)]` macro, so that it won't complain.
- Make sure your code is correctly formatted: `cargo fmt --all --check`.
- Make sure your `Cargo.toml`'s are sorted: `cargo +nightly sort --workspace`. This command uses the [cargo-sort crate](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-sort) to sort the `Cargo.toml` dependencies alphabetically.
- If you've made changes to examples, make sure the above commands are ran there as well.

## Project Layout

The folders in this repository relate to each other as follow:

    classDef binary fill:#f25100,font-weight:bolder,stroke-width:0,color:white;

    cargo-shuttle:::binary
    common
    codegen
    e2e
    proto
    provisioner:::binary
    service
    gateway:::binary
    user([user service]):::external
    gateway --> common
    gateway -.->|starts instances| deployer
    deployer --> proto
    deployer -.->|calls| provisioner
    service ---> common
    deployer --> common
    cargo-shuttle --->|"features = ['loader']"| service
    deployer -->|"features = ['loader']"| service
    cargo-shuttle --> common
    service --> codegen
    proto ---> common
    provisioner --> proto
    e2e -.->|starts up| gateway
    e2e -.->|calls| cargo-shuttle
    user -->|"features = ['codegen']"| service
```

First, `provisioner`, `gateway`, `deployer`, and `cargo-shuttle` are binary crates with `provisioner`, `gateway` and `deployer` being backend services. The `cargo-shuttle` binary is the `cargo shuttle` command used by users.

The rest are the following libraries:
- `common` contains shared models and functions used by the other libraries and binaries.
- `codegen` contains our proc-macro code which gets exposed to user services from `service` by the `codegen` feature flag. The redirect through `service` is to make it available under the prettier name of `shuttle_service::main`.
- `service` is where our special `Service` trait is defined. Anything implementing this `Service` can be loaded by the `deployer` and the local runner in `cargo-shuttle`.
   The `codegen` automatically implements the `Service` trait for any user service.
- `proto` contains the gRPC server and client definitions to allow `deployer` to communicate with `provisioner`.
- `e2e` just contains tests which starts up the `deployer` in a container and then deploys services to it using `cargo-shuttle`.

Lastly, the `user service` is not a folder in this repository, but is the user service that will be deployed by `deployer`.

## Windows Considerations

Currently, if you try to use 'make images' on Windows, you may find that the shell files cannot be read by Bash/WSL. This is due to the fact that Windows may have pulled the files in CRLF format rather than LF[^1], which causes problems with Bash as to run the commands, Linux needs the file in LF format. 

Thankfully, we can fix this problem by simply using the `git config core.autocrlf` command to change how Git handles line endings. It takes a single argument:

```
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

This should allow you to run `make images` and other Make commands with no issues.

If you need to change it back for whatever reason, you can just change the last argument from 'input' to 'true' like so:
```
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```
After you run this command, you should be able to checkout projects that are maintained using CRLF (Windows) again.
