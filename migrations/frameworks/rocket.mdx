## Reference

### Quickstart
Shuttle has a native integration for Rocket by default with the `shuttle-rocket` crate.

See the following code comparison below:

<CodeGroup>
```rust main.rs (before)
#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build()
}
```
```rust main.rs (after)
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn rocket() -> shuttle_rocket::ShuttleRocket {
    let rocket = rocket::build();

    Ok(rocket.into())
}
```
```toml Cargo.toml (before)
[dependencies]
rocket = 0.5
tokio = 1
```
```toml Cargo.toml (after)
[dependencies]
rocket = 0.5
tokio = 1

shuttle-runtime = 0.48
shuttle-rocket = 0.48
```
</CodeGroup>


## How does it work?
The Shuttle runtime exposes a trait, `shuttle_runtime::Service`, that services are required to implement before being able to run on Shuttle.

The `shuttle-rocket` crate exposes an aliased Result type (`shuttle_rocket::ShuttleRocket`) which simply wraps your router and implements `From<T>` which allows use of `.into()` on your Router. This integration includes serving the router itself.

If you want more custom behavior that is not supported by the native Shuttle integration, you can create a struct with your own custom implementation of `shuttle_runtime::Service`. You can find more about this [here](/migrations/frameworks/rocket)
