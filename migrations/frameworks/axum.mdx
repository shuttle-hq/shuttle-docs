## Reference

### Quickstart
Shuttle has a native integration for Axum by default with the `shuttle-axum` crate.

See the following code comparison below:

<CodeGroup>
```rust main.rs (before)
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
  // whatever router you have here
  let router = axum::Router::new();

  let tcp_listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8000").await?;

  axum::serve(tcp_listener, router).await?;

  Ok(())
}
```
```rust main.rs (after)
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main() -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    let router = axum::Router::new();

    Ok(router.into())
}
```
```toml Cargo.toml (before)
[dependencies]
axum = 0.7.5
tokio = 1
```
```toml Cargo.toml (after)
[dependencies]
axum = 0.7.5
tokio = 1

shuttle-runtime = 0.48
shuttle-axum = 0.48
```
</CodeGroup>



## How does it work?
The Shuttle runtime exposes a trait, `shuttle_runtime::Service`, that services are required to implement before being able to run on Shuttle.

The `shuttle-axum` crate exposes an aliased Result type (`shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum`) which simply wraps your router and implements `From<axum::Router>` which allows use of `.into()` on your Router. This integration includes serving the router itself.

If you want more custom behavior that is not supported by the native Shuttle integration, you can create a struct with your own custom implementation of `shuttle_runtime::Service`.
