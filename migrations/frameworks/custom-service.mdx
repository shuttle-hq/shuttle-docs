## Reference

### Quickstart

To get started, you can use the following code below:

<CodeGroup>
```rust data.rs
pub struct DataStruct;

impl shuttle_runtime::Service for DataStruct {
  async fn bind(
    mut self,
    addr: std::net::SocketAddr
  ) -> Result<(), shuttle_runtime::Error> {
    // whatever code you want goes here
    Ok(())
  }
}
```

```rust main.rs
mod data;
use data::DataStruct;

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main() -> Result<DataStruct, shuttle_runtime::Error> {
  Ok(DataStruct)
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Note that you can add fields to your struct for any annotation macros you'd like to add as extra data (for example: adding a Postgres connection or pool to your application).

### Run a non-HTTP framework service
Note that the code that goes in the `bind()` function **must** eventually use a looping mechanism or be awaiting some kind of HTTP request, otherwise the function will finish and end the service.

<CodeGroup>
```rust Looping
loop {
  // your code goes here
}
```
```rust Looping with time intervals
// Note that although you can use `sleep()` here, it is not as accurate
// as using tokio::time::interval because the interval will stick to a strict time
let mut interval = tokio::time::interval(std::Duration::from_millis(10));

loop {
  interval.tick().await;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Run multiple tasks at once
If you want to run multiple services at once, it is relatively easy to do so. We store the variable without awaiting the future.
```rust data.rs
pub struct DataStruct;

async fn loop() {
  let mut interval = tokio::time::interval(std::Duration::from_secs(10));

  loop {
    println!("Hello world from the loop function!");
    interval.tick().await;
  }
}

impl shuttle_runtime::Service for DataStruct {
  async fn bind(
    mut self,
    addr: std::net::SocketAddr
  ) -> Result<(), shuttle_runtime::Error> {
    let router = axum::Router::new();
    let tcp_listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind(&addr).await.unwrap();

    let serve = axum::serve(tcp_listener, router);

    tokio::join!(
      serve,
      loop()
    );

    Ok(())
  }
}
```
The advantage of this over simply spawning a `tokio::Task` in a service with a Shuttle integration is primarily that both functions run concurrently on the same task.

## How does it work?

The Shuttle runtime exposes a trait `shuttle_runtime::Service` which you can implement on a struct you own to be able to augment the runtime behavior of your application.

You may find this useful in the following cases:
- You need custom launch behavior for your web application
- You need to run multiple things at the same time (ie, a Discord bot and an Actix Web server) in a Tokio task
- You need to run a HTTP client but don't need a web server (ie, a cron job that uses `serenity` with only the HTTP feature enabled to send some requests to Discord)

Note that only one HTTP service can be bound at a time - if you require more than one address per project, feel free to reach out and let us know!
