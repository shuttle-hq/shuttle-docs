This example shows how to migrate an Axum app with a Postgres database.

<Note>
    This guide assumes that you have Shuttle already setup.
    If you don't, head on over to our [installation](/getting-started/installation) guide.
</Note>

## Add Shuttle dependencies

The first step is to add `shuttle-runtime` and `shuttle-axum` to your dependencies to be able to use Shuttle's runtime with the Axum framework.

```bash
cargo add shuttle-runtime shuttle-axum
```

Any [secrets](/resources/shuttle-secrets) you need to use will be kept in a `Secrets.toml` file (dev secrets in `Secrets.dev.toml`) which will be placed at the `Cargo.toml` level.

You can also easily get a provisioned database like so (this example will be for a provisioned PostgreSQL instance specifically):

```bash
cargo add shuttle-shared-db --features postgres,sqlx
```

If you have any database records you'd like to keep, it would be a good idea to export them so that they can be migrated to the new database.
**You will not need a secrets file if you only need a provisioned Postgres database - this will be automatically be provisioned and given to you in the form of a connection string or an sqlx pool.**

## Migrate your Code

To be able to run your project on Shuttle, you need to make a few changes to your code.
Instead of the `tokio::main` macro, you will use the `shuttle_runtime::main` macro and swap out `dotenvy` for Shuttle's Postgres annotation:

This is what your `main.rs` file looks like before:

```rust main.rs
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    dotenvy::dotenv().ok();

    let db_url = dotenvy::var("DATABASE_URL").expect("No database URL was set!");
    let secret = dotenvy::var("MY_SECRET").expect("No secret was set!");

    let pool = sqlx::Pool::connect(&db_url).await.unwrap();
    sqlx::migrate!()
        .run(&pool)
        .await
        .expect("Migrations failed :(");

    // Use secrets for anything that needs them

    let router = create_api_router(pool);
    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([0, 0, 0, 0], 8000));

    Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(router.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap()
}
```

And this is what it looks like after:

```rust main.rs
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
pub async fn axum (
    #[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] pool: PgPool,
    #[shuttle_runtime::Secrets] secrets: shuttle_runtime::SecretStore,
) -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    sqlx::migrate!()
        .run(&pool)
        .await
        .expect("Migrations failed :(");

    // Use secrets for anything that needs them

    let router = create_api_router(pool);

    Ok(router.into())
}
```

If you need more than custom set up behavior, you'll need to [create a custom service.](https://docs.shuttle.dev/tutorials/custom-service)

Anything outside of your entry point function (the function that uses the `shuttle_runtime::main` macro) doesn't need to be changed.

If you need to share variables between your handlers (for example, a database connection), the best way to do this is typically creating a struct that holds all of them - in the Rust web ecosystem this is commonly referred to as [application state](https://www.shuttle.dev/blog/2023/12/06/using-axum-rust#app-state-in-axum) (or app state).

## Local run

Test your app locally with:

```bash
shuttle run
```

## Deploying

Now all you need to do is to run the following command:

```bash
shuttle deploy
```

Your project should now be deployed!
