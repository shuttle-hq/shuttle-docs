This section revolves around simple Actix examples you can get quickly started with by following these 3 steps:
1. Initialize a new Actix project by running the `cargo shuttle init --template actix-web` command
2. Copy pasting the contents of the example you want to deploy -- make sure to check the tabs of the snippet(s) to ensure you are copying the right code/file
3. Running the `cargo shuttle deploy` command

<Tip>If you are looking for step-by-step guides, check out our [How To](../tutorials) section.</Tip>

You can clone the example below by running the following (you'll need `cargo-shuttle` installed):
```bash
cargo shuttle init --template actix-web 
```

<CodeGroup>
```rust src/main.rs
use actix_web::{get, web::ServiceConfig};
use shuttle_actix_web::ShuttleActixWeb;

#[get("/")]
async fn hello_world() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World!"
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn actix_web(
) -> ShuttleActixWeb<impl FnOnce(&mut ServiceConfig) + Send + Clone + 'static> {
    let config = move |cfg: &mut ServiceConfig| {
        cfg.service(hello_world);
    };

    Ok(config.into())
}
```

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
actix-web = "4.3.1"
shuttle-actix-web = "0.33.0"
shuttle-runtime = "0.33.0"
tokio = "1.26.0"
```
