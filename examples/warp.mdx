Simple 'Hello world' app using Warp.

Create a new directory (`mkdir`) and move into it (`cd`) -- afterwards, execute the following command to initialize shuttle inside with the Warp boilerplate.

```bash
cargo shuttle init --warp
```

Make sure that your `Cargo.toml` file looks like the one below -- having the right dependencies is key!

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]

[dependencies]
shuttle-service = { version = "0.7.2", features = ["web-warp"] }
warp = "0.3.2"
```
Your `lib.rs` should look like this:

```Rust lib.rs
use warp::Filter;
use warp::Reply;

#[shuttle_service::main]
async fn warp() -> shuttle_service::ShuttleWarp<(impl Reply,)> {
    let route = warp::any().map(|| "Hello, World");
    Ok(route.boxed())
}

```
Create a project, this will start an isolated deployer container for you under the hood:
```bash
cargo shuttle project new
```
Finally, to deploy your app, all you need to do is:
```bash
cargo shuttle deploy
```

And your app is live! 🎉🎉🎉
