## Hello world!

Simple 'Hello world' app using Warp.

Create a new directory (`mkdir`) and move into it (`cd`) -- afterwards, execute the following command to initialize shuttle inside with the Warp boilerplate.

```bash
cargo shuttle init --warp
```

Make sure that your `Cargo.toml` file looks like the one below -- having the right dependencies is key!

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
shuttle-runtime = { version = "0.1.0" }
shuttle-warp = { version = "0.1.0" }
tokio = { version = "1.26.0" }
warp = "0.3.3"
```
Your `main.rs` should look like this:

```Rust main.rs
use warp::Filter;
use warp::Reply;

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn warp() -> shuttle_warp::ShuttleWarp<(impl Reply,)> {
    let route = warp::any().map(|| "Hello, World!");
    Ok(route.boxed().into())
}
```

Finally, to deploy your app, all you need to do is:
```bash
cargo shuttle deploy
```

And your app is live! 🎉🎉🎉
