## Hello world!

Simple 'Hello world' app using Salvo.

Create a new directory (`mkdir`) and move into it (`cd`) -- afterwards, execute the following command to initialize shuttle inside with the Salvo boilerplate.

```bash
cargo shuttle init --template salvo
```

Make sure that your `Cargo.toml` file looks like the one below -- having the right dependencies is key!

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
salvo = "0.37.5"
shuttle-salvo = { version = "0.15.0" }
shuttle-runtime = { version = "0.15.0" }
tokio = { version = "1.26.0" }
```
Your `main.rs` should look like this:

```Rust main.rs
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[handler]
async fn hello_world(res: &mut Response) {
    res.render(Text::Plain("Hello, world!"));
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn salvo() -> shuttle_salvo::ShuttleSalvo {
    let router = Router::with_path("hello").get(hello_world);

    Ok(router.into())
}
```

Finally, to deploy your app, all you need to do is:
```bash
cargo shuttle deploy
```

And your app is live! 🎉🎉🎉
