```bash
cargo shuttle init --no-framework
```

This will simply initialize a new cargo crate with a dependency on `shuttle-service`.
We also need to add `sqlx` and `shuttle-shared-db` for this example, make sure your
`Cargo.toml` looks like the one below. 

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "custom-service"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]

[dependencies]
shuttle-service = { version = "0.10.0" }
shuttle-shared-db = { version = "0.10.0", features = ["postgres"] }
sqlx = { version = "0.6", features = ["runtime-tokio-native-tls", "postgres"] }
```

This section will explain how to create a custom shuttle service. To do this we need 
to return a struct from our `shuttle_service::main` function that implements `shuttle_service::Service`.

In this simple example we will implement `Service` for a `PgPool`, that will simply return 'Hello world'
from the database on startup. In Rust we can't implement foreign traits for foreign types, so we have 
to create a wrapper around our `PgPool`.

```rust
struct PoolService {
    pool: sqlx::PgPool,
}
```

Then we need to implement `shuttle_service::Service` for our wrapper. If you need to bind to an address,
for example if you're implementing service for an HTTP server, you can use the `addr` argument from `bind`.
You can only have one HTTP service bound to the `addr`, but you can start other services that don't rely on 
binding to a socket. A common usecase is starting an HTTP server like `axum`, alongside a `serenity` bot 
that doesn't need to bind to a socket. Then you would include both in the same wrapper struct, and start 
them as normal in the `bind` function.

```rust lib.rs
#[shuttle_service::async_trait]
impl shuttle_service::Service for PoolService {
    async fn bind(
        mut self: Box<Self>,
        _addr: std::net::SocketAddr,
    ) -> Result<(), shuttle_service::error::Error> {
        self.start().await?;

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

To finish up, we return the wrapper struct from our `shuttle_service::main` function:

```rust lib.rs
use shuttle_service::error::CustomError;

#[shuttle_service::main]
async fn init(
    #[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] pool: sqlx::PgPool,
) -> Result<PoolService, shuttle_service::Error> {
    Ok(PoolService { pool })
}

impl PoolService {
    async fn start(&self) -> Result<(), CustomError> {
        let (rec,): (String,) = sqlx::query_as("SELECT 'Hello world'")
            .fetch_one(&self.pool)
            .await
            .map_err(CustomError::new)?;

        assert_eq!(rec, "Hello world");

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Try it out with the `run` command:

```bash
cargo shuttle run
```
