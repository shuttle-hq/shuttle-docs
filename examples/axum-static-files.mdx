```rust src/main.rs
use std::path::PathBuf;

use axum::{routing::get, Router};
use tower_http::services::ServeDir;

async fn hello_world() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn axum() -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    let router = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(hello_world))
        .nest_service("/assets", ServeDir::new(PathBuf::from("assets")));

    Ok(router.into())
}
```
