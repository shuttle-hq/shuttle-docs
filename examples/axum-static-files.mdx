This example shows how to serve files from a folder with static assets.
Running this example and going to `/assets` will serve you the `assets/index.html` file.

```rust src/main.rs
use std::path::PathBuf;

use axum::{routing::get, Router};
use tower_http::services::ServeDir;

async fn hello_world() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn axum(
    // Name your static assets folder by passing `folder = <name>` to `StaticFolder`
    // If you don't pass a name, it will default to `static`.
    #[shuttle_static_folder::StaticFolder(folder = "assets")] static_folder: PathBuf,
) -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    let router = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(hello_world))
        .nest_service("/assets", ServeDir::new(static_folder));

    Ok(router.into())
}
```

```html assets/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Static Files</title>
