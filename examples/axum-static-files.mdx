title: "Static Files"
description: "This article walks you through setting up static files with Axum, a powerful Rust framework maintained by the Tokio-rs team."
---

## Description

This example has one route at `/` where the homepage is served and shows you how you can serve HTML or other types of files with Actix Web.

Note that static assets are declared in the `Shuttle.toml` file.

You can clone the example below by running the following (you'll need `cargo-shuttle` installed):

```bash
cargo shuttle init --from shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples \
  --subfolder axum/static-files
```

## Code

<CodeGroup>
```rust src/main.rs
use axum::{routing::get, Router};
use tower_http::services::ServeDir;

async fn hello_world() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main() -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    let router = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(hello_world))
        .nest_service("/assets", ServeDir::new("assets"));

    Ok(router.into())
}
```

```html assets/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Static Files</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is an example of serving static files with Axum and Shuttle.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "static-files"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
publish = false

[dependencies]
axum = "0.7.3"
shuttle-axum = "0.40.0"
shuttle-runtime = "0.40.0"
tokio = "1.28.2"
tower-http = { version = "0.5.0", features = ["fs"] }
```

```toml Shuttle.toml
assets = ["assets/*"]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

After you clone the example, launch it locally by using `cargo shuttle run` then visit the home route at `http://localhost:8000` - you should see a homepage that shows our included HTML file. 

You can extend this example by adding more routes that serve other files.
