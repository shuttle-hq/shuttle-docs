title: "Static Files"
description: "This article walks you through setting up static files with Rocket, an ergonomic framework for simple web applications."

## Description

This example has one route at `/` where the homepage is served and shows you how you can serve HTML or other types of files with Rocket.

Note that static assets are declared in the `Shuttle.toml` file.

You can clone the example below by running the following (you'll need `cargo-shuttle` installed):
```bash
cargo shuttle init --from shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples \
 --subfolder rocket/static-files
```

## Code
 
<CodeGroup>
```rust src/main.rs
use rocket::fs::NamedFile;
use rocket::fs::{relative};
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

#[rocket::get("/<path..>")]
pub async fn serve(mut path: PathBuf) -> Option<NamedFile> {
    path.set_extension("html");
    let mut path = Path::new(relative!("assets")).join(path);
    if path.is_dir() {
        path.push("index.html");
    }

    NamedFile::open(path).await.ok()
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn rocket() -> shuttle_rocket::ShuttleRocket {
    let rocket = rocket::build().mount("/", rocket::routes![serve]);

    Ok(rocket.into())
}
```

```html assets/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Static Files</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is an example of serving static files with Rocket and Shuttle.</p>

```html assets/about.html
<!DOCTYPE html>

    <head>
        <title>Static Files</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is the About page.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "static-files"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
publish = false

[dependencies]
rocket = "0.5.0"
shuttle-rocket = "0.46.0"
shuttle-runtime = "0.46.0"
tokio = "1.26.0"
```

```toml Shuttle.toml
assets = ["assets/*"]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

After you clone the example, launch it locally by using `cargo shuttle run` then visit the home route at `http://localhost:8000` - you should see a homepage that shows our included HTML file. 

You can extend this example by adding more routes that serve other files.
