This section revolves around simple Axum examples you can get quickly started with by following these 3 steps:
1. Initialize a new Axum project by running the `shuttle init --template axum` command
2. Copy pasting the contents of the example you want to deploy -- make sure to check the tabs of the snippet(s) to ensure you are copying the right code/file
3. Running the `shuttle deploy` command

<Tip>If you are looking for step-by-step guides, check out our [Tutorials](/templates/tutorials) section.</Tip>

You can clone the example below by running the following (you'll need `shuttle` CLI installed):

```bash
shuttle init --template axum
```

<CodeGroup>
```rust src/main.rs
use axum::{routing::get, Router};

async fn hello_world() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn axum() -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {

    let router = Router::new().route("/", get(hello_world));

    Ok(router.into())
}
```

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
axum = "0.7.4"
shuttle-axum = "0.49.0"
shuttle-runtime = "0.49.0"
tokio = "1.28.2"
