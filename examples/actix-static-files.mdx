title: "Static Files"
description: "This article walks you through setting up static files with Actix Web, a powerful Rust framework for battle-hardened web applications."
---

## Description

This example has one route at `/` where the homepage is served and shows you how you can serve HTML or other types of files with Actix Web.

Note that static assets are declared in the `Shuttle.toml` file.

You can clone the example below by running the following (you'll need `cargo-shuttle` installed):
```bash
cargo shuttle init --from shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples \
 --subfolder actix-web/static-files
```

## Code

<CodeGroup>
```rust src/main.rs
use actix_files::NamedFile;
use actix_web::{get, web::ServiceConfig, Responder};
use shuttle_actix_web::ShuttleActixWeb;

#[get("/")]
async fn index() -> impl Responder {
    NamedFile::open_async("assets/index.html").await
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn actix_web() -> ShuttleActixWeb<impl FnOnce(&mut ServiceConfig) + Send + Clone + 'static> {
    let config = move |cfg: &mut ServiceConfig| {
        cfg.service(index);
    };

    Ok(config.into())
}
```

```html assets/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Static Files</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is an example of serving static files with Actix Web and Shuttle.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "static-files"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
actix-web = "4.3.1"
actix-files = "0.6.2"
shuttle-actix-web = "0.27.0"
shuttle-runtime = "0.27.0"
tokio = "1.26.0"
```

```toml Shuttle.toml
assets = ["assets/*"]
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

After you clone the example, launch it locally by using `cargo shuttle run` then visit the home route at `http://localhost:8000` - you should see a homepage that shows our included HTML file. 

You can extend this example by adding more routes that serve other files.
