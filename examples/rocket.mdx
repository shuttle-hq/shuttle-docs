This section revolves around simple Rocket examples you can get quickly started with by following these 3 steps:
1. Initialize a new Rocket project by running the `cargo shuttle init --template rocket` command
2. Copy pasting the contents of the example you want to deploy -- make sure to check the tabs of the snippet(s) to ensure you are copying the right code/file
3. Running the `cargo shuttle deploy` command

<Tip>If you are looking for step-by-step guides, check out our [Tutorials](/templates/tutorials) section.</Tip>

You can clone the example below by running the following (you'll need `cargo-shuttle` installed):
```bash
cargo shuttle init --template rocket
```

<CodeGroup>
```rust main.rs
#[macro_use]
extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn rocket() -> shuttle_rocket::ShuttleRocket {
    let rocket = rocket::build().mount("/hello", routes![index]);

    Ok(rocket.into())
}
```

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
rocket = "0.5.0"
shuttle-rocket = "0.40.0"
shuttle-runtime = "0.40.0"
tokio = "1.26.0"
```
