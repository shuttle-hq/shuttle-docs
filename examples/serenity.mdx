title: "Hello World Bot"
description: "Serenity is a Rust library for the Discord API."
---

This section revolves around simple Serenity examples you can get quickly started with by following these 4 steps:
1. Go through the steps in **Prerequisites** below
2. Initialize a new Serenity project by running the `shuttle init --template serenity` command
3. Copy pasting the contents of the example you want to deploy -- make sure to check the tabs of the snippet(s) to ensure you are copying the right code/file
4. Running the `shuttle deploy` command

### Prerequisites

To get started log in to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

1. Click the New Application button, name your application and click Create.
2. Navigate to the Bot tab in the lefthand menu, and add a new bot.
3. On the bot page click the Reset Token button to reveal your token. Put this token in your `Secrets.toml`. It's very important that you don't reveal your token to anyone, as it can be abused. Create a `.gitignore` file to omit your `Secrets.toml` from version control.
4. For the sake of this example, you also need to scroll down on the bot page to the Message Content Intent section and enable that option.

To add the bot to a server we need to create an invite link.

1. On your bot's application page, open the OAuth2 page via the lefthand panel.
2. Go to the URL Generator via the lefthand panel, and select the `bot` scope as well as the `Send Messages` permission in the Bot Permissions section.
3. Copy the URL, open it in your browser and select a Discord server you wish to invite the bot to.

### Code

This example shows how to build a Serenity bot with Shuttle that responds to the `!hello` command with `world!`.

<CodeGroup>
```rust src/main.rs
use anyhow::Context as _;
use serenity::async_trait;
use serenity::model::channel::Message;
use serenity::model::gateway::Ready;
use serenity::prelude::*;
use shuttle_runtime::SecretStore;
use tracing::{error, info};

struct Bot;

#[async_trait]
impl EventHandler for Bot {
    async fn message(&self, ctx: Context, msg: Message) {
        if msg.content == "!hello" {
            if let Err(e) = msg.channel_id.say(&ctx.http, "world!").await {
                error!("Error sending message: {:?}", e);
            }
        }
    }

    async fn ready(&self, _: Context, ready: Ready) {
        info!("{} is connected!", ready.user.name);
    }
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn serenity(
    #[shuttle_runtime::Secrets] secrets: SecretStore,
) -> shuttle_serenity::ShuttleSerenity {
    // Get the discord token set in `Secrets.toml`
    let token = secrets.get("DISCORD_TOKEN").context("'DISCORD_TOKEN' was not found")?;

    // Set gateway intents, which decides what events the bot will be notified about
    let intents = GatewayIntents::GUILD_MESSAGES | GatewayIntents::MESSAGE_CONTENT;

    let client = Client::builder(&token, intents)
        .event_handler(Bot)
        .await
        .expect("Err creating client");

    Ok(client.into())
}
```

```toml Secrets.toml
DISCORD_TOKEN = 'the contents of your discord token'
```

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello-world-serenity-bot"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
anyhow = "1.0.66"
serenity = { version = "0.12.0", default-features = false, features = ["client", "gateway", "rustls_backend", "model"] }
shuttle-runtime = "0.55.0"
shuttle-serenity = "0.55.0"
