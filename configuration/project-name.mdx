Your Shuttle Project Name determines which subdomain your project is hosted on (`https://<project-name>.shuttleapp.rs/`).
Therefore, your project name has to be unique.
You might also want to use a name that is short and easy to remember.

<Info>In the free Community Tier, you can own a total of 3 project names at once. See [Pricing](https://www.shuttle.rs/pricing) for Pro tier benefits, such as more projects.</Info>

## Specifying Project Name

The name of your Shuttle project can be set up in three different ways.
They are listed below in the same order as `cargo-shuttle` will prioritize them.

### via the `--name` option

When running commands, the project name can always be overridden with the `--name` option, regardless of which directory you are in.

```bash
# Create a project called `my-project-name`
cargo shuttle start --name my-project-name

# Check the deployment list of `my-project-name`
cargo shuttle deployment list --name my-project-name
```

### via Shuttle.toml

The next method to specify a project name is by creating a `Shuttle.toml` file at the root level of the project's workspace.
In this file, place a key-value pair like so:

```toml Shuttle.toml
name = "my-project-name"
```

### via Cargo.toml

In the absence of either of the previous two options, the project will be named based on the content of the `name = ` field of the `[package]` section in the `Cargo.toml` configuration file.

A new Shuttle project can be named by passing in a project name with the `--name` option, for example:

```bash
cargo shuttle init --template axum --name my-project-name some-directory
```

This will create a new Axum-based project in `some-directory` and update the name field in `Cargo.toml` accordingly.

## Workspaces

If your project is a cargo workspace the name will be taken from a `Shuttle.toml` in the root of the workspace, or
from the directory name of the workspace. See [Project structure](/configuration/project-structure).
