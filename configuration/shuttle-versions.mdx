- When you start or restart a project, a Shuttle `deployer` Docker container is started with the [latest released](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases) version of Shuttle.
- When you deploy something to that project, the version of your `shuttle-runtime` and other `shuttle-...` cargo dependencies are recommended to be of the same version of `deployer`, as there might be breaking changes between releases.
- It is also recommended to keep `cargo-shuttle` up to date with the current version of the Shuttle API (see [latest release](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases)).

## Upgrading Shuttle version

Combining all of the above, these are the recommended steps for upgrading a Shuttle app.

<Info>Note: Please check the [release page](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases) for any considerations regarding breaking changes in the new release.</Info>

1. Upgrade your `cargo-shuttle` CLI with one of the options below:
   - `curl -sSfL https://www.shuttle.rs/install | bash` (Linux and macOS)
   - `cargo binstall cargo-shuttle`
   - `cargo install cargo-shuttle`

2. Update your project's `shuttle-...` dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml Cargo.toml
   shuttle-runtime = "0.43.0"
   # etc
   ```

3. Test that your project works with `cargo check` / `cargo build` / `cargo shuttle run`.

4. Upgrade your project container with `cargo shuttle project restart` (remember to use `--idle-minutes` if relevant). This will not delete any databases, and you will keep your project name.

5. Finally, redeploy your Shuttle app: `cargo shuttle deploy`. *(if you want to, commit your changes first)*
