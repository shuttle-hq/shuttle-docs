By adding a custom domain to your project, web traffic can be served on your own fancy domain name instead of `*.shuttleapp.rs`.

You can add a root-level domain (`example.com`) or a subdomain (`thing.example.com`).

Adding a custom domain to your project follows these steps:
- Purchase a domain name from a DNS provider,
- set up a DNS record to make it point to your Shuttle server, and
- get an SSL certificate that enables HTTPS traffic to your project.

# Set up DNS record

The process for setting up the required DNS rule looks different depending on which type of domain and registrar you have.

## Cloudflare

If you have your domain name on Cloudflare, the process is quite simple. Go to `Websites -> <your domain> -> DNS -> Records -> Add Record`, then follow the relevant section below.

### Root domain

Add a `CNAME` record from `@` to your `.shuttleapp.rs` subdomain. Disable the Proxy.

Adding a `CNAME` on the root level here is possible due to Cloudflare's [CNAME flattening](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/).

You can also add a `CNAME` for the `www` subdomain if you also want traffic to `www.example.com` to arrive to your service.

### Subdomain

Add a `CNAME` record from your subdomain to your `.shuttleapp.rs` subdomain. Disable the Proxy.

In the example above, the subdomain `thing` (as in `thing.my-domain.com`) is being directed to `example.shuttleapp.rs`.

## Other DNS providers

The process for other providers can vary, but here are the general steps. If you want to add docs for a specific provider, feel free to contribute to this page.

### Root domain

If you are adding a root-level domain, add an `A` record that points to the same IP address that is returned by `dig A example.shuttleapp.rs`, which is currently `18.132.234.15`.

### Subdomain

If you are adding a subdomain, add a `CNAME` record from your subdomain to your `.shuttleapp.rs` subdomain.
