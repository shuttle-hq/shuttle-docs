By adding a custom domain to your project, web traffic can be served on your own fancy domain name instead of `*.shuttleapp.rs`.

You can add a root-level domain (`example.com`) or a subdomain (`thing.example.com`).

Adding a custom domain to your project follows these steps:
- Purchase a domain name from a DNS provider,
- set up a DNS record to make it point to your Shuttle server, and
- get an SSL certificate that enables HTTPS traffic to your project.

# Set up DNS record

The process for setting up the required DNS rule looks different depending on which type of domain and registrar you have.

## Cloudflare

If you have your domain name on Cloudflare, the process is quite simple. Go to `Websites -> <your domain> -> DNS -> Records -> Add Record`, then follow the relevant section below.

### Root domain

Add a `CNAME` record from `@` to your `.shuttleapp.rs` subdomain. Disable the Proxy.

Adding a `CNAME` on the root level here is possible due to Cloudflare's [CNAME flattening](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/).

You can also add a `CNAME` for the `www` subdomain if you also want traffic to `www.example.com` to arrive to your service.

### Subdomain

Add a `CNAME` record from your subdomain to your `.shuttleapp.rs` subdomain. Disable the Proxy.

In the example above, the subdomain `thing` (as in `thing.my-domain.com`) is being directed to `example.shuttleapp.rs`.

## Other DNS providers

The process for other providers can vary, but here are the general steps. If you want to add docs for a specific provider, feel free to contribute to this page.

### Root domain

If you are adding a root-level domain, add an `A` record that points to the same IP address that is returned by `dig A example.shuttleapp.rs`, which is currently `18.132.234.15`.

### Subdomain

If you are adding a subdomain, add a `CNAME` record from your subdomain to your `.shuttleapp.rs` subdomain.

# Set up SSL certificate

When your DNS record has propagated, you want to get an SSL certificate signed by Shuttle.

For now, you have to reach out to the Shuttle team on Discord or `support@shuttle.rs` to set up your SSL certificate manually, but this will soon be automated.
