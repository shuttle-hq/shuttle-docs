title: "Shuttle Service Name"
---

The name of a Shuttle service (your project), can be set up front as part of the ```cargo shuttle init``` command. In the series of setup questions, the name is the first to be chosen.  Later, to change the name, a configuration file called ```Shuttle.toml``` can be created in the root of the project folder, at the same level as ```Cargo.toml```.  In this file, simply put: ```name = <your-project-name>```. As soon as the ```Shuttle.toml``` file exits, it will control the name of the Shuttle service and override other choices.
