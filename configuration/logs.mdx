Shuttle will record anything your application writes to `stdout`, e.g. a `tracing` or `log` crate configured to write to `stdout`,
or simply `println!`. By default, Shuttle will set up a global tracing subscriber behind the scenes. If you'd rather set up
your own tracing or logging, you can opt-out of the default subscriber by disabling the default features on `shuttle-runtime`:

```toml Cargo.toml
shuttle-runtime = { version = "*", default-features = false }
```

For `shuttle-next` projects the default global subscriber is installed by default and it can not be opted out of.

## Default Tracing Subscriber

With the default features enabled you can skip the step of initializing your subscriber when implementing [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/)
in your application, all you have to do is add `tracing` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`, and you're good to go!

```rust
// [...]
use tracing::info;

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn axum(#[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] pool: PgPool) -> ShuttleAxum {
    info!("Running database migration");
    pool.execute(include_str!("../schema.sql"))
        .await
        .map_err(CustomError::new)?;

    // [...]
}
```

If you'd rather use [log](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/), everything from the above section on tracing applies.
A log-compatible layer is added to the global subscriber, so like with tracing, all you need to do to use `log` macros
in your project is add it to your `Cargo.toml`.

### Configuring the default subscriber

The global subscriber has an `env_filter` which defaults to the `INFO` log level if no `RUST_LOG` variable is set.
You can change the log level for local runs with `RUST_LOG="..." cargo shuttle run`.

Deployments use `RUST_LOG="shuttle=debug,info"`, and this is not configurable at the moment. A custom subscriber can be set up instead.

## Custom logging setup

If you opt-out of the default subscriber, you can set up logging or tracing the way you would in any other Rust application.
The only thing you need to ensure is that your setup writes to `stdout`, as this is what Shuttle will record and return from
the `cargo shuttle logs` commands.

We've created an example Actix Web app with a simple `tracing`: [custom tracing example](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples/tree/main/tracing/custom-tracing-subscriber).

## Viewing Logs

We have a few commands that are useful for viewing your application's logs.

To view the logs for your current `running` deployment, if there is one:

```bash
cargo shuttle logs
```

*Caveat: The above command finds the oldest deployment in the `running` state. [related issue](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/1067)*

You can also view logs of a specific deployment by adding the deployment id to this command:

```bash
cargo shuttle logs <id>
```

To get the deployment ID, you can run this command to view your deployment history:

```bash
cargo shuttle deployment list
```

The `--latest` flag will simply get the logs from the latest deployment (at the top of the table):

```bash
cargo shuttle logs --latest
```

And last but not least, if you'd like a live feed of your logs (from a running deployment):

```bash
cargo shuttle logs --follow
```
