A Loco Hello World project is more complex than other frameworks and is not shown here in full.
Check out one of these ways to use Loco:

## Generate Shuttle deployment config

Loco CLI provides a command for generating everything needed for deploy a Loco app on Shuttle.
Read more in the [Loco deployment docs](https://loco.rs/docs/infrastructure/deployment/)!

## Starter template for Loco on Shuttle

There is also a full Hello World [example](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples/tree/main/loco/hello-world).
You can use it by running `shuttle init` and selecting the Loco Hello World template.
