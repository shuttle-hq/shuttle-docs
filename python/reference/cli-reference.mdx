## Overview

The Shuttle CLI for Python is your primary interface for developing, deploying, and managing applications on the Shuttle platform. This reference provides comprehensive documentation for all commands and options.

## Installation

It is recommended to use `uv` for dependency management and running the Shuttle CLI.

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv add shuttle-python
```

Once installed, you can invoke the Shuttle CLI using `uv run -m shuttle`. If your virtual environment is activated, you can also run commands directly using `shuttle`.
For example:

```bash
uv run -m shuttle deploy
# OR
shuttle deploy
```

## Global Options

These options are common to many command-line interfaces and may be supported by the underlying Python `click` framework, but are not explicitly defined or handled by the `shuttle` Python application's `__main__.py` for all cases.

| Option                       | Description                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--debug`                    | Turn on tracing output for Shuttle libraries (WARNING: can print sensitive data) |

## Commands Reference

### Project Management

### Deployment

#### `shuttle deploy`

Provision, build, and deploy the application.

```bash
uv run -m shuttle deploy [PATH]
# OR
shuttle deploy [PATH]
```

**Arguments:**

- `[PATH]` - The path to your Shuttle project's root directory (defaults to current directory).

**Examples:**

```bash
uv run -m shuttle deploy # Deploy the project in the current directory
shuttle deploy # Deploy the project in the current directory

uv run -m shuttle deploy my-project # Deploy a project located in 'my-project' directory
shuttle deploy my-project # Deploy a project located in 'my-project' directory
```

#### `shuttle destroy`

Destroy the deployed stack and all associated resources for a project.

```bash
uv run -m shuttle destroy [PATH]
# OR
shuttle destroy [PATH]
```

**Arguments:**

- `[PATH]` - The path to your Shuttle project's root directory (defaults to current directory).

**Examples:**

```bash
uv run -m shuttle destroy # Destroy the project in the current directory
shuttle destroy # Destroy the project in the current directory

uv run -m shuttle destroy my-project # Destroy a project located in 'my-project' directory
shuttle destroy my-project # Destroy a project located in 'my-project' directory
```

### Local Development

#### `shuttle run`

Run your Shuttle project locally.

```bash
uv run -m shuttle run [PATH]
# OR
shuttle run [PATH]
```

**Arguments:**

- `[PATH]` - The path to your Shuttle project's root directory (defaults to current directory).

**Examples:**

```bash
uv run -m shuttle run # Run the project in the current directory locally
shuttle run # Run the project in the current directory locally

uv run -m shuttle run my-project # Run a project located in 'my-project' directory locally
shuttle run my-project # Run a project located in 'my-project' directory locally
```

### Logs

#### `shuttle logs`

Show logs from the deployed application.

```bash
uv run -m shuttle logs [PATH]
# OR
shuttle logs [PATH]
```

**Arguments:**

- `[PATH]` - The path to your Shuttle project's root directory (defaults to current directory).

**Examples:**

```bash
uv run -m shuttle logs # View logs for the project in the current directory
shuttle logs # View logs for the project in the current directory

uv run -m shuttle logs my-project # View logs for a project located in 'my-project' directory
shuttle logs my-project # View logs for a project located in 'my-project' directory
```

## Environment Variables

The Shuttle Python CLI primarily relies on AWS authentication configured in your environment.

| Variable                 | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`      | Your AWS access key ID. Used for programmatic access to AWS.                                            |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`  | Your AWS secret access key. Used in conjunction with `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`.                               |
| `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`      | (Optional) The session token for temporary AWS credentials.                                             |
| `AWS_PROFILE`            | The name of the AWS profile to use from your AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`).               |
| `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN`  | Used for testing with LocalStack; typically not needed for standard deployments.                        |

You can configure your AWS credentials using `aws configure` or `aws configure sso` via the AWS CLI.

## Configuration Files

### `pyproject.toml` (and project structure)

Shuttle Python projects are standard Python projects, typically managed with `pyproject.toml`. Your application code, including `@shuttle_task.cron` decorated functions, resides within your project's Python source files (e.g., `main.py` or `src/my_project/task.py`).

```toml
[project]
name = "my-shuttle-project"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = [
    "shuttle-python",
    # ... other dependencies
]
```

## Common Workflows

### First Deployment

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv add shuttle
# Add your Shuttle Python code and dependencies (e.g., shuttle-aws, shuttle-db)
uv run -m shuttle deploy  # Deploy to AWS infrastructure managed by Shuttle
# OR
shuttle deploy
uv run -m shuttle run     # Test locally against provisioned infrastructure
# OR
shuttle run
```

### Development Cycle

```bash
uv run -m shuttle deploy  # Deploy changes
# OR
shuttle deploy
uv run -m shuttle run     # Develop locally against provisioned infrastructure
# OR
shuttle run
uv run -m shuttle logs    # Check deployment logs
# OR
shuttle logs
```

### Project Management

```bash
# The Python CLI manages projects through their local paths.
# To remove a project and its deployed resources:
uv run -m shuttle destroy
# OR
shuttle destroy
```

### Debugging

```bash
uv run -m shuttle logs                  # Check recent logs
# OR
shuttle logs
uv run -m shuttle deploy --debug        # Verbose deployment (if --debug is implemented)
# OR
shuttle deploy --debug
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AWS Authentication issues:**

- Ensure your AWS credentials are correctly configured via environment variables or `~/.aws/credentials`.
- Use `aws configure` or `aws configure sso`.

**Local development issues:**

- Ensure you are in the correct virtual environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`).
- Verify that your project path is correct (e.g., `.` for the current directory).
- Check for `FileNotFoundError` if `main.py` or `__main__.py` is missing in your project root.

**Deployment issues:**

- Check `uv run -m shuttle logs` for build or deployment errors.
- Ensure all Python dependencies are specified in `pyproject.toml` and installed (`uv add shuttle` or `uv sync` as appropriate).

## Getting Help

```bash
uv run -m shuttle --help                   # General help
# OR
shuttle --help
uv run -m shuttle <command> --help        # Command-specific help (if supported by click)
# OR
shuttle <command> --help
```
