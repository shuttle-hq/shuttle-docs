# Using Shuttle within your projects

For managing dependencies and running Shuttle commands within your projects, it is recommended to use `uv` directly.

1. Create a Virtual Environment:

    Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment with `uv`.

    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. Add Shuttle Dependency:

    Add the `shuttle` package to your project's dependencies.

    ```bash
    uv init
    uv add shuttle-python
    ```

3. Run Shuttle Commands:

    Execute Shuttle commands using `uv run -m shuttle` to ensure they run within your project's isolated environment.

    ```bash
    uv run -m shuttle deploy
    uv run -m shuttle logs
    uv run -m shuttle local
    ```

    Alternatively, if you are activated in your virtual environment, you can use the `shuttle` script.

    ```bash
    shuttle deploy
    shuttle logs
    shuttle local
    ```
