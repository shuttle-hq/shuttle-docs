## Deploy your project

1.  **Configure AWS Credentials**
    Before deploying, ensure you have authenticated with AWS using one of the following methods:
    -   **SSO Enabled**: Use `aws configure sso` for AWS Single Sign-On.
    -   **IAM User Account**: Use `aws configure` for standard IAM user credentials.
    -   **Temporary IAM Credentials**: Set the following environment variables:
        ```sh
        export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
        export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
        export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN='your_session_token'
        ```
    -   **Other Options**: IAM role metadata and OIDC federation are also supported.

2.  **Install uv for Virtual Environment Management**
    ```sh
    pip install uv
    ```

3.  **Navigate to Your Project Directory**
    Change into the newly created project directory:
    ```sh
    cd <your-project-name>
    ```

4.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    ```sh
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

5.  **Add Shuttle Dependency**
    ```sh
    uv init
    uv add shuttle-python
    ```

6.  **Create Your Shuttle Project**
    There is no `shuttle init` command for Python projects. Instead, you must create your project files manually.

    Create a `main.py` file: you can use the [built-in user-project example](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-python/blob/main/user-project/__main__.py) as a starting point.


7.  **Deploy Your Project**
    Deploy your application to the Shuttle platform:
    ```sh
    shuttle deploy
    # or
    uv run -m shuttle deploy
    ```
    Follow the prompts to confirm deployment.

8.  **View Application Logs**
    To view logs from your deployed application:
    ```sh
    shuttle logs
    # or
    uv run -m shuttle logs
    ```

9.  **Run Your Project Locally (Optional)**
    To run your application locally using deployed resources:
    ```sh
    shuttle run
    # or
    uv run -m shuttle run
    ```
    Note: This will execute your application's `main` function (or equivalent entrypoint) and connect to the remote resources provisioned in the cloud.

10. **Destroy Your Project (Cleanup)**
    When you're finished, you can destroy all provisioned infrastructure and associated resources:
    ```sh
    shuttle destroy
    # or
    uv run -m shuttle destroy
    ```
