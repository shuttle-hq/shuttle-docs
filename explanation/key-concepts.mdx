  >
    The paradigm shift: instead of provisioning infrastructure separately and then deploying code, you declare what you need directly in your application code and Shuttle provisions it automatically.

  <Card
    title="Resource Abstraction"
    icon="database"
    href="/explanation/key-concepts/resource-abstraction"
  >
    Shuttle provides high-level abstractions (databases, secrets, external services) that you request by type, not by specific configuration. You ask for "a Postgres database" and get one, without VPC setup, connection strings, etc.

  >
    Your development environment mirrors production automatically - when you run locally, Shuttle spins up the same resources (via Docker) that you'll have in production.

    title="Zero-Config Deployment"
    icon="rocket"
    href="/explanation/key-concepts/zero-config-deployment"
  >
    The elimination of deployment configuration files, CI/CD setup, and infrastructure management - shuttle deploy handles everything from code to running service.
