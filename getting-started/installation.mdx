## Install Script (Recommended)

The install script finds the optimal alternative for installing the latest version on your OS, architecture and distro.
It's the easiest way to get started.
It also helps you to install Rust if you haven't yet.

### Linux and macOS

```sh
curl -sSfL https://www.shuttle.dev/install | bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
iwr https://www.shuttle.dev/install-win | iex
```

<Info>
The install script collects anonymous telemetry data to help improve the product.

<Accordion title="Read more">
No IP address or similar is collected.
The collected data is:

- Platform (OS)
- Installation method used, and whether it is a new install or upgrade
- Success/Failure outcome, and which step that failed
- Start and end times of script execution

You can opt out by setting any of these environment variables to `1` or `true`:

- `DO_NOT_TRACK`
- `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`
- `SHUTTLE_DISABLE_TELEMETRY`
- `CI`

The scripts for both platforms are open source [[1]](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/blob/main/install.sh) [[2]](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/blob/main/install.ps1). Improvements are always welcome!

## Alternative Installation Methods

### cargo-binstall

If you prefer using Cargo's package manager, you can use [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall):

```sh
cargo binstall cargo-shuttle
```

### From Source

For those who prefer building from source:
