## Install Shuttle

The `cargo-shuttle` CLI can be installed with a pre-built binary or from source with cargo.

### Pre-built binary

Shuttle provides pre-built binaries of the `cargo-shuttle` CLI with every release
for most platforms, they can be found on [our GitHub](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases/latest).

Our binaries can also be installed using [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall),
which will automatically install the correct target for your system.
To install with `cargo-binstall`, run:

```sh
cargo binstall cargo-shuttle
```

### From source

Although a bit slower, you can also install directly with cargo:

```sh
cargo install cargo-shuttle
```

<Note>If you are using an M1/M2 Mac, `cargo install cargo-shuttle` might not work for you due to an issue with the `cargo-generate` upstream dependency. In those cases, it is advised to install Shuttle with `binstall`.</Note>

### Arch Linux

`cargo-shuttle` can be installed from the [community repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/cargo-shuttle/) using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman):

```sh
pacman -S cargo-shuttle
```

> This is a community package maintained by [orhun](https://github.com/orhun).

## Login

After installing, log in with:

```sh
cargo shuttle login
```

Once you've done this, you are good to go!
