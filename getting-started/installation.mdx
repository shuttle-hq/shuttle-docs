## Install Shuttle

The `cargo-shuttle` CLI can be installed with a pre-built binary, from source with cargo, or with the install script.

### Install script

The install script finds the optimal alternative below for installing the latest version on your OS, architecture and distro.

Run it on Linux and macOS with:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://www.shuttle.rs/install | bash
```

Or on Windows with:

```powershell
iwr "https://www.shuttle.rs/install-win" | iex
```

### Pre-built binary

Pre-built binaries of the `cargo-shuttle` CLI for most platforms can be found on [our GitHub](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases/latest).

The binaries can also be installed using [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall),
which will automatically download the correct binary for your system.
To install with `cargo-binstall`, run:

```sh
cargo binstall cargo-shuttle
```

### From source

Although a bit slower, you can also install directly with cargo:

```sh
cargo install cargo-shuttle
```

<Note>Installing cargo-shuttle from source requires Rust 1.70+. You can verify by running `cargo --version`.</Note>

### Arch Linux

`cargo-shuttle` can be installed from the [community repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/cargo-shuttle/) using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman):

```sh
pacman -S cargo-shuttle
```

> This is a community package maintained by [orhun](https://github.com/orhun).

## Login

After installing, log in with:

```sh
cargo shuttle login
```
