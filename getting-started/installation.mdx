## Install Script (Recommended)

The install script finds the optimal alternative for installing the latest version on your OS, architecture and distro.
It's the easiest way to get started.
It also helps you to install Rust if you don't have it.

### Linux and macOS

```sh
curl -sSfL https://www.shuttle.dev/install | bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
iwr https://www.shuttle.dev/install-win | iex
```

<Info>
The install script collects anonymous telemetry data to help improve the product.
You can opt out by setting any of these environment variables to `1` or `true`:

- `DO_NOT_TRACK`
- `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`
- `SHUTTLE_DISABLE_TELEMETRY`
- `CI`
</Info>

### Pre-built binary

## Alternative Installation Methods

### cargo-binstall

If you prefer using Cargo's package manager, you can use [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall):

```sh
cargo binstall cargo-shuttle

### From Source

For those who prefer building from source:

<Note>Building from source requires a Rust toolchain and may take longer than other installation methods.</Note>
