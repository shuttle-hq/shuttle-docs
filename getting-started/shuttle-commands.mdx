## Cookbook / Cheat Sheet

These are some useful sequences of commands that are handy to keep in your back pocket.

- `cargo shuttle login`: Open the Shuttle Console and paste the API key to log in.
- `cargo shuttle init`: Log in and initialize a project.

### Local run

- `cargo shuttle run`: Run the project locally so you can test your changes. For more tips, see [Local Run](./local-run).
- `cargo shuttle run --port 8080`: Change the local port.
- `cargo shuttle run --port 8080 --external`: Expose to local network by listening on `0.0.0.0`.
- `cargo shuttle run --secrets <file>`: Use a non-default secrets file for this run.

### Start and deploy a project

- `cargo shuttle project start`: Start the container for this project on Shuttle.
- `cargo shuttle deploy`: Deploy the project to Shuttle.
- `cargo shuttle deploy --allow-dirty`: Deploy regardless whether there are pending git changes. Alias: `--ad`.
- `cargo shuttle deploy --no-test`: Don't run unit tests before starting the deployment. Alias: `--nt`.
- `cargo shuttle deploy --secrets <file>`: Use a non-default secrets file for this deployment. It must be located in the same folder that Secrets.toml should be in.

</Tip>

- `cargo shuttle project list`: List your projects.
- `cargo shuttle project status`: Check the state of this project.
- `cargo shuttle project restart`: Restart your project's container and upgrade to the latest deployer. See [Upgrading](/configuration/shuttle-versions#upgrading-shuttle-version).
- `cargo shuttle project delete`: Delete a project. The project might need to be restarted first, and all resources need to be deleted first.

### Manage deployments and logs

- `cargo shuttle deployment list`: List deployments in this project.
- `cargo shuttle status`: Show status of the currently running deployment.
- `cargo shuttle stop`: Stop the currently running deployment.
- `cargo shuttle logs`: Get all logs from the currently running deployment.
- `cargo shuttle logs --latest`: Get all logs from the currently running deployment.
- `cargo shuttle logs <id>`: Get all logs from a specific deployment.
- `cargo shuttle logs --follow`: Stream logs of the deployed service and stream them to your terminal.

### Manage resources
