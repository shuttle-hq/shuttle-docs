<Note>
This page assumes that you have installed the Shuttle CLI.
If you haven't, go to the [installation](./installation) guide.
</Note>

## Login

The login command opens the [Shuttle Console](https://console.shuttle.dev/) to authenticate your CLI:

```sh
shuttle login
```

## Create your first project

The init command lets you generate a Hello World project or clone one of our [examples](/examples) or [templates](/templates).
For your first project, try a Hello World template.

```sh
shuttle init
```

You can then `cd` into the created folder and run your app locally. Check out the [local run](/docs/local-run) page for more.

```sh
shuttle run
```

Then, the app can be deployed with:

```sh
shuttle deploy
```

This uploads your code and builds it.
After that, the resulting Docker image is launched and hosted, and can start receiving HTTPS traffic.
