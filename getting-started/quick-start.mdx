We will assume that you have already installed Shuttle and logged in.
If you haven't, you should check out our [installation](./installation) section.

**Creating your first project**

To initialize your project, simply write:

```sh
cargo shuttle init
```

![Shuttle Scaffolding](/images/actix-scaffold-demo.gif)

You can then `cd` into the folder and try the app locally:

```sh
cargo shuttle run
```

In case you didn't create the project environment in the `init` command, run:

```sh
cargo shuttle project start
```

Then, the app can be deployed with:

```sh
cargo shuttle deploy --allow-dirty
```

<Info>`--allow-dirty` or `--ad` allows deploying with uncommitted git changes.</Info>

You can also run your project locally for development, check out our [local run](./local-run) section.

Feel free to build on top of the generated "Hello, World!" project or check out one of our [examples](/examples) or [templates](/templates).
