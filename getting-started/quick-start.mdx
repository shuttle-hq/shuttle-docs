<Note>
This guide assumes you have installed the Shuttle CLI. If you haven't, please visit the [installation guide](./installation) first.
</Note>

## Login to Your Account

First, you'll need to authenticate with Shuttle. The login command will open your browser to the [Shuttle Console](https://console.shuttle.dev/) where you can authenticate:

```sh
shuttle login
```

<Info>You can use your Google account, GitHub account or email to authenticate with Shuttle.</Info>

## Create Your First Project

The `init` command helps you create a new Shuttle project. You can choose from:
- A simple Hello World template
- One of our [example projects](/examples)
- A [pre-built template](/templates)

For your first project, we recommend starting with the Hello World template:

```sh
shuttle init
```

The CLI will guide you through:
1. Choosing a project name
2. Selecting a template
3. Setting up your project structure

<Info>Your project name will be used as part of the deployment URL. Choose something unique and descriptive.</Info>


## Run Your Project Locally

Before deploying, you can run your project locally to test it:

```sh
shuttle run
```

## Deploy Your Project

When you're ready to deploy your project to the cloud:

```sh
shuttle deploy
```

This will:
1. Upload your code to Shuttle's platform and build it into a Docker image
2. Deploy it to our infrastructure and assign a public HTTPS URL

<Info>The first deployment might take a few minutes as it builds your project and sets up the infrastructure.</Info>
