Interaction with the Shuttle platform is mainly done with the `shuttle` Command Line Interface (CLI).
Some tasks, such as viewing logs, can also be done in the [Shuttle Console](https://console.shuttle.dev/).

To get an overview of available commands, subcommands, and options, run:

```bash
shuttle help
# or
shuttle <command> --help

## Cookbook / Cheat Sheet

These are some useful sequences of commands that are handy to keep in your back pocket.
For full documentation, use `--help` on the respective command.
Use the global `--debug` flag to print detailed debug output.

### Get started

- `cargo install cargo-shuttle`: For more alternatives, see [Installation](/getting-started/installation).
- `shuttle login`: Log in via the Shuttle Console.
- `shuttle init`: Generate a project from a template.
- `shuttle account`: Check account details.

### Local run

For more tips, see [Local Run](/docs/local-run).

- `shuttle run`: Run the project locally so you can test your changes.
- `shuttle run --port 8080`: Change the local port.
- `shuttle run --port 8080 --external`: Expose to local network by listening on `0.0.0.0`.
- `shuttle run --secrets <file>`: Use a non-default secrets file for this run.
- `shuttle run --release`: Compile with release mode.

### Start and deploy a project

- `shuttle project create`: Start the container for this project on Shuttle.
- `shuttle deploy`: Deploy the project to Shuttle.
- `shuttle deploy --no-follow`: Don't poll deployment state. Alias: `--nf`.
- `shuttle deploy --secrets <file>`: Use a non-default secrets file for this deployment. It must be located in the same folder that Secrets.toml should be in.

### Manage projects

<Tip>
All project-related commands can use:
- `--working-directory <path>` or `--wd <path>` to execute the command in a different folder.
- `--name <name>` to specify project name explicitly (see [Project](/docs/projects#project-name-and-id)).
- `--id <id>` to specify project id explicitly (see [Project](/docs/projects#project-name-and-id)).
</Tip>

- `shuttle project list`: List your projects.
- `shuttle project status`: Check the state of this project.
- `shuttle project link`: Link this project folder to a project on Shuttle.
- `shuttle project delete`: Delete a project.
- `shuttle project update name <new-name>`: Rename a project.

### Manage deployments and logs

- `shuttle deployment list`: List deployments in this project.
- `shuttle deployment status`: Show status of the currently running deployment.
- `shuttle deployment stop`: Stop any currently running deployments.
- `shuttle logs`: Get all logs from the currently running deployment.
- `shuttle logs --latest`: Get all logs from the latest deployment.
- `shuttle logs <id>`: Get all logs from a specific deployment.
- `shuttle logs --raw`: Print the logs without timestamps and origin tags. The `--raw` flag is also available for the `run` and `deploy` commands.

### Manage resources

- `shuttle resource list`: List resources linked to this project.
- `shuttle resource delete <type>`: Delete a resource such as databases and secrets.

### Shell completions

Use `shuttle generate shell <shell>` with one of: bash, elvish, fish, powershell, zsh.

Example configuration for Zsh on Linux: add `eval "$(shuttle generate shell zsh)"` to `~/.zshrc`.

### Utility

- `shuttle <command> --debug`: Turn on tracing output for Shuttle libraries. (WARNING: can print sensitive data)
- `shuttle deploy --output-archive <path>`: Dump the deployment archive to disk instead of deploying it. Useful for debugging.
