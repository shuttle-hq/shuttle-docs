# Shuttle Docs

## Contributing

If you found an error in our docs, or you simply want to make them better, contributions are always appreciated!

Our docs are powered by [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) ([docs](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart)). To run them for local development:

Install [their cli](https://mintlify.com/docs/installation). NOTE: This requires Node v19+

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

And from the root of the repository, run:

```bash
mint dev
```
