This section is aimed at collecting common issues users have to provide quick debug solutions.

  <Accordion title="I've updated Shuttle and my project isn't working anymore.">
    If you've recently updated Shuttle, in order to get your project back up, you need to run:
    `cargo shuttle project restart` and everything should be back in working order.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I return custom errors with Shuttle?">
    CustomError is an alias for `anyhow::Error`, the simplest way to output a relevant message here is by using `anyhow::Context` like this:

    ```rust
    use anyhow::Context;

    pool.execute(include_str!("../schema.sql"))
        .await
        .context("failed to run migrations")?;
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I handle environment variables?">
    Add `shuttle-secrets` to the dependencies for your service, and add a `Secrets.toml` to the root of your project with the secrets you'd like to store. Make sure to add `Secrets*.toml` to your `.gitignore` to omit your secrets from version control.

    Next, pass `#[shuttle_secrets::Secrets] secret_store: SecretStore` as an argument to your `shuttle_runtime::main` function. `SecretStore::get` can now be called to retrieve your API keys and other secrets at runtime.

    For more details, and an explanation on how to use local secrets, head on over here: [Shuttle secrets](../resources/shuttle-secrets).
