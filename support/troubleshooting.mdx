  <Accordion title="How can I return custom errors with Shuttle?">
    CustomError is an alias for `anyhow::Error`, the simplest way to output a relevant message here is by using `anyhow::Context` like this:

    ```rust
    use anyhow::Context;

    pool.execute(include_str!("../schema.sql"))
        .await
        .context("failed to run migrations")?;
    ```
