<Warning>Deleting old projects can fail due to outdated or corrupt data. If you have tried all the steps below, but they keep failing or if a resource refuses to be deleted, please contact us on *support@shuttle.rs* from the email associated with your GitHub account. There, we can assist you with manually deleting projects.</Warning>

To delete a project, start off with

```bash
cargo shuttle project delete --name <name>
```

<Note>In these examples, the `--name` flag is used to specify the project name explicitly. Depending on your files, you might not need it. See [Project name](/configuration/project-name) for other alternatives.</Note>

If the delete command gives you a 503 error, try restarting the project. This is needed in order to check if the project has resources linked.

```bash
cargo shuttle project restart --name <name>
cargo shuttle project delete --name <name>
```

If you have a running deployment, you will be asked to stop it.

```bash
cargo shuttle stop --name <name>
```

If you have secrets recorded in the project, you will be asked to delete them.

```bash
cargo shuttle resource delete secrets --name <name>
```

If you have databases linked to the project, you will be asked to delete them.

```bash
# check which type of database
cargo shuttle resource list --name <name>
# example for a shared postgres db
cargo shuttle resource delete database::shared::postgres --name <name>
```

If secrets or databases are not being deleted successfully with the above commands, please contact us for further support.
