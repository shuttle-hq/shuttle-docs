title: "Installing Protoc"
---

Since `v0.12.0` `protoc` is a requirement to use and install `cargo-shuttle`. To install `protoc`, here
are some instructions for Windows, Linux and Mac:

### Windows

On Windows the simplest way to install `protoc` is to first install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), 
and then simply run: `choco install protoc`.

### Linux and Mac

For Linux and Mac you can use this install script:
```bash
# replace <arch> with your architecture, for example for linux x86_64 replace <arch> with: linux-x86_64
curl -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v21.9/protoc-21.9-<arch>.zip &&\
    sudo unzip -o protoc-21.9-<arch>.zip -d /usr/local bin/protoc &&\
    sudo unzip -o protoc-21.9-<arch>.zip -d /usr/local 'include/*' &&\
    rm -f protoc-21.9-<arch>.zip
```
If you'd like to do this yourself without the above script, see instructions here: https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/#install-pre-compiled-binaries-any-os

On Mac you can also install protoc with `brew`: `brew install protobuf`.

**Note:** *installing `protoc` on Linux with `apt-get install protobuf-compiler` will not be enough, 
since it will install an old version of `protoc` (v3.12) but it needs to be at least v3.19. 
Installing on mac using brew works.*
