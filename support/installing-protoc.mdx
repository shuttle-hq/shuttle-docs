title: "Installing Protoc"
---

Since shuttle v0.12.0, `protoc` is a requirement to install `cargo-shuttle` and to use `cargo-runtime`.
Here are some instructions for installing `protoc` on Windows, Linux and Mac:

### Windows

On Windows the simplest way to install `protoc` is to first install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), 
and then simply run: `choco install protoc`.

Then, verify that it's working:

```bash
# should show a version number
protoc --version
```

**Note:** *You might need to restart your shell.
If you are using the integrated terminal in VS Code, you need to restart VS Code.
See [here](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/troubleshooting#my-path-is-not-getting-updated)
for more troubleshooting tips, or feel free to ask for help in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/shuttle).*

### Linux and Mac

For Linux and Mac you can use these commands:
```bash
# Replace <arch> with your architecture, for example:
# Linux with Intel/AMD:  linux-x86_64
# Mac with Intel:        osx-x86_64
# Mac M1 etc:            osx-aarch_64
# see https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases for all alternatives
ARCH="<arch>" && \
VERSION="22.2" && \
curl -OL "https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v$VERSION/protoc-$VERSION-$ARCH.zip" && \
sudo unzip -o "protoc-$VERSION-$ARCH.zip" bin/protoc "include/*" -d /usr/local && \
rm -f "protoc-$VERSION-$ARCH.zip"
```

If you'd like to do this yourself without the above script, see instructions here (but use a newer version):
https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/#install-pre-compiled-binaries-any-os

On Mac you can also install protoc with `brew`: `brew install protobuf`.

**Note:** *installing `protoc` on Linux with `apt-get install protobuf-compiler` will not be enough, 
since it will install an old version of `protoc` (v3.12) but it needs to be at least v3.19. 
Installing on mac using brew works.*

Then, verify that it's working:

```bash
# should show a version number
protoc --version
```
