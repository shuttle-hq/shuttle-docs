1. Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases) for any considerations regarding breaking changes in the new release.

2. Upgrade your Shuttle CLI with one of the options below:
   - `shuttle upgrade` **(available in v0.48.0+)** (runs the install script below for you)
   - `curl -sSfL https://www.shuttle.dev/install | bash` (Linux and macOS)
   - `iwr https://www.shuttle.dev/install-win | iex` (Windows)
   - `cargo binstall cargo-shuttle`
   - `cargo install cargo-shuttle`

3. Update your project's Shuttle dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml Cargo.toml
   shuttle-runtime = "0.56.0"
   # do the same for other shuttle dependencies
   ```

4. Test that your project works with `cargo check` / `shuttle run`.

5. Finally, redeploy your Shuttle app with `shuttle deploy`.
