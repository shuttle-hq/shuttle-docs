  This guide assumes you have already installed the Shuttle CLI. If you haven't,
  please visit the [installation guide](../getting-started/installation) first.
</Note>

## Problem

You want to quickly get a Rust web application deployed to the cloud with minimal setup and configuration.

## Solution

Follow these steps to go from zero to deployed in under 5 minutes:

### 1. Authenticate with Shuttle

```sh
shuttle login
```

This opens your browser to the [Shuttle Console](https://console.shuttle.dev/) where you can authenticate with Google, GitHub, or email.

### 2. Create Your Project

```sh
shuttle init --template axum my-app
cd my-app
```

Choose from available templates:

- `axum` - Modern, ergonomic web framework
- `rocket` - Type-safe web framework
- `actix` - Actor-based web framework
- `serenity` - Discord bot framework

### 3. Test Locally (Optional)

```sh
shuttle run
```

Your app runs at `http://localhost:8000`. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

### 4. Deploy to Production

```sh
shuttle deploy
```

**That's it!** Shuttle will:

1. Build your application
2. Provision any required infrastructure
3. Deploy to AWS with HTTPS
4. Provide you with a live URL

<Info>
  Your first deployment may take 2-3 minutes as Shuttle sets up your project
  infrastructure.
</Info>

## What You Get

- ✅ **HTTPS by default** - Secure endpoints from day one
- ✅ **Custom subdomain** - `https://my-app-xyz.shuttle.app`
- ✅ **Automatic builds** - No Docker or CI/CD setup needed
- ✅ **Zero configuration** - Infrastructure provisioned automatically

## Adding a Database

Need a database? Just add the annotation:

```rust
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(
    #[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] pool: sqlx::PgPool,
) -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    // Database is automatically provisioned and connected
}
```

Update your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
shuttle-shared-db = "0.56.0"
sqlx = { version = "0.8", features = ["runtime-tokio-rustls", "postgres"] }
```

Then deploy again:

```sh
shuttle deploy
```

## Useful Commands

### Check Deployment Status

```sh
shuttle project status
```

### View Logs

```sh
shuttle logs
```

### List Your Projects

```sh
shuttle project list
```

### Update Your App

```sh
# Make code changes, then:
shuttle deploy
```

## Next Steps

- **Add more resources**: Try adding secrets, AWS RDS, or external integrations
- **Custom domains**: Set up your own domain name
- **Learn the CLI**: Explore all available commands with `shuttle help`
- **Join the community**: Get help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/shuttle)

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment failed?**

- Check `shuttle logs` for error details
- Ensure your `Cargo.toml` has correct dependencies
- Try `shuttle project status` to see project state

**Local run issues?**

- Make sure Docker is running (needed for databases)
- Check if port 8000 is available, or use `--port` flag

**Authentication problems?**

- Try `shuttle logout` then `shuttle login` again
