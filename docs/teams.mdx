<Info>The teams feature is in beta and will be receiving updates.</Info>

Shuttle teams enables you to supercharge your team's productivity by sharing projects with your team members and centralize billing.

## Features

Your team can be managed on the Shuttle Console under **Account -> Team**.
Currently, only the team owner can manage the team.

### Members

The team owner can invite team members via email.

<Note>The invited user must sign in to Shuttle using the same email address you provide.</Note>

There are by default 10 seats in a team. Additional team seats can be purchased.

### Projects

Currently, all of the team owner's projects are shared with all team members.

To collaborate on a new project within the team, the team owner must create the project.

Both of the limitations above will soon go away.

<Note>Using `--name` in the CLI will prioritise Personal projects with that name over team projects. Using `--id` or linking the local directory ensures that the correct project is always targetted.</Note>

### Roles

The team member roles that exist so far are:

- **Owner:** Admin access to all team projects and can delete team projects.
- **Admin:** Admin access to all team projects.
{/* - **Member (coming soon):** Basic read-only access to all team projects. */}
