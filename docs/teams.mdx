Shuttle Teams is a feature exclusive to [Growth Tier](https://www.shuttle.dev/pricing) users, enabling you to supercharge your team's productivity, share projects within your team, and centralize billing.

## Features

Your team can be managed on the Shuttle Console under **Account -> Team**.

### Members

Team admins can invite new team members via email.

<Note>The invited user must sign in to Shuttle using the same email address you provide.</Note>

There are by default 10 seats in a team. Additional team seats can be purchased by contacting us.

### Projects

All of the team owner's projects are shared with all team members.

To collaborate on a new project within the team, the team owner must create the project.
Once the project is created, the team can perform all actions except deleting the project.

<Note>Using `--name` in the CLI will prioritise Personal projects with that name over team projects. Using `--id` or linking the local directory ensures that the correct project is always targetted.</Note>

### Roles

- **Owner:** Admin access to all team projects and can delete team projects.
- **Admin:** Admin access to all team projects.

## Upcoming Updates

- Giving the team a name.
- More team roles for fine grained access.
- Moving projects in and out of the team, keeping personal projects private.
