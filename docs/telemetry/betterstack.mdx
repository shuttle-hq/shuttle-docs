description: How to set up Better Stack monitoring with Shuttle
---

This guide will walk you through setting up Better Stack as your telemetry provider for Shuttle.

## Prerequisites

1. A [Better Stack account](https://betterstack.com/) (sign up if you don't have one)

## Step 1: Create a Telemetry Source in Better Stack

1. Log in to your Better Stack account
2. Navigate to the **Sources** section
3. Click **Connect Source**
4. Choose a name for your telemetry source
5. Select the OpenTelemetry option in the "platform" section
6. Click "Connect Source" at the bottom of the page

## Step 2: Configure Shuttle Project

1. On the Source configuration page, locate and copy:
   - Your source token
   - The ingestion host URL

2. In the Shuttle Console:
   - Navigate to your project
   - Go to the "Telemetry" tab
   - Click to enable Better Stack
   - Paste your source token and ingestion host
   - Click "Apply"

## Step 3: Enable OpenTelemetry Exporter (optional)

<Note>
    This step is only required if you want to emit custom metrics and logs from your application. If you only need the default CPU, network, and memory metrics, you can skip this step.
</Note>

Follow the [Getting Started guide](./getting-started#step-1-enable-the-opentelemetry-exporter) to enable the OpenTelemetry exporter in your project.

## Step 4: Redeploy Your Project

<Warning>
    **Important**: If your project was already running, you must redeploy it for telemetry to start flowing.
    
    - If you've made code changes (like adding custom metrics), redeploy using the Shuttle CLI: `shuttle deploy`
    - If you haven't made any code changes, you can redeploy from the Shuttle Console by selecting your latest deployment and clicking "Redeploy"
</Warning>

## Step 5: Create Dashboards

Once telemetry data starts flowing, you can create custom dashboards in Better Stack:

1. Go to the Dashboards section
2. A new dashboard will be created automatically for your project
3. Click the dots on any widget and select "Configure" to customize it

Better Stack offers several ways to visualize your data:
- SQL queries
- Visual drag-and-drop interface
- PromQL (beta)

### Import Pre-configured Better Stack Dashboard

To quickly get started with basic resource metrics, follow these steps:

1. Download the Better Stack basic resource metrics JSON file by clicking the download button from our [examples repository](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples/blob/main/README.md)
2. Go to your Better Stack dashboard through the Dashboards section
3. Click the three dots (â‹®) in the top-right corner of your dashboard and select "Import" as shown below:
![Importing a dashboard in Better Stack](/images/telemetry/betterstack-import.png)

4. In the import dialog, select the JSON file you downloaded from our examples repository
5. After importing, you'll see new charts under the "Resource Metrics Charts" section, but they won't display any data yet
6. To see your data, select your source from the source dropdown at the top of the page:
![Selecting the data source](/images/telemetry/betterstack-source.png)

7. Click "Save changes" to apply the source selection

Your dashboard will now display the following metrics under the "Resource Metrics Charts" section:
- Metric points per second (showing successfully pushed vs failed metrics)
- vCPU Reserved (grouped by project)
- vCPU Used (grouped by project)
- Memory Usage (grouped by project)
- Network Egress in bytes (grouped by project)
- Network Ingress in bytes (grouped by project)
- Network Bandwidth showing both egress and ingress rates

### Example: Creating a CPU Usage Graph

1. Click the dots on a widget and select "Configure"
2. Switch to the visual interface
3. Add `cpu_usage_vcpu` as your metric
4. Set the Y-axis unit to "vCPU"
5. Group by your project name

## Available Metrics

Better Stack will receive all the standard Shuttle telemetry metrics, including:
- CPU usage and utilization
- Memory usage and limits
- Network I/O statistics
- Disk I/O statistics
- Custom metrics from your application (requires OpenTelemetry exporter from Step 3)

For a complete list of available metrics, see our [telemetry overview](./overview#default-platform-metrics).

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see data in Better Stack:
1. Verify your source token and ingestion host are correct
2. If you're using custom metrics, check that your project has the `setup-otel-exporter` feature on `shuttle-runtime` enabled
3. Ensure you've redeployed your project after enabling telemetry
4. Contact [Better Stack support](https://betterstack.com/contact) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/shuttle) for help
