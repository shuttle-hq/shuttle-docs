---

This guide will walk you through setting up Better Stack as your telemetry provider for Shuttle.

## Prerequisites

1. A [Better Stack account](https://betterstack.com/) (sign up if you don't have one)
2. A Shuttle project with the OpenTelemetry exporter enabled (see [Getting Started](./getting-started))

## Step 1: Create a Telemetry Source in Better Stack

1. Log in to your Better Stack account
2. Navigate to the **Sources** section
3. Click **Connect Source**
4. Choose a name for your telemetry source
5. Select the OpenTelemetry option in the "platform" section
6. Click "Connect Source" at the bottom of the page

## Step 2: Configure Shuttle Project

1. On the Source configuration page, locate and copy:
   - Your source token
   - The ingestion host URL

2. In the Shuttle Console:
   - Navigate to your project
   - Go to the "Telemetry" tab
   - Click to enable Better Stack
   - Paste your source token and ingestion host
   - Click "Apply"

<Warning>
    **Important**: If your project was already running, you must redeploy it for telemetry to start flowing.
    To redeploy, select your latest deployment in the Shuttle Console and click "Redeploy".
</Warning>

## Step 3: Create Dashboards

Once telemetry data starts flowing, you can create custom dashboards in Better Stack:

1. Go to the Dashboards section
2. A new dashboard will be created automatically for your project
3. Click the dots on any widget and select "Configure" to customize it

Better Stack offers several ways to visualize your data:
- SQL queries
- Visual drag-and-drop interface
- PromQL (beta)

### Example: Creating a CPU Usage Graph

1. Click the dots on a widget and select "Configure"
2. Switch to the visual interface
3. Add `cpu_usage_vcpu` as your metric
4. Set the Y-axis unit to "vCPU"
5. Group by your project name

## Available Metrics

Better Stack will receive all the standard Shuttle telemetry metrics, including:
- CPU usage and utilization
- Memory usage and limits
- Network I/O statistics
- Disk I/O statistics
- Custom metrics from your application

For a complete list of available metrics, see our [telemetry overview](./overview#platform-telemetry).

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see data in Better Stack:
1. Verify your source token and ingestion host are correct
2. Check that your project has the `setup-otel-exporter` feature on `shuttle-runtime` enabled
3. Ensure you've redeployed your project after enabling telemetry
4. Contact [Better Stack support](https://betterstack.com/contact) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/shuttle) for help
