description: Step-by-step guide to setting up telemetry in your Shuttle project
---

This guide will walk you through setting up telemetry for your Shuttle project. We'll cover the basic setup that applies to all telemetry providers, and then point you to provider-specific guides.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
1. A Shuttle project deployed
2. Access to the Shuttle Console
3. An account with your chosen telemetry provider (e.g. Better Stack)

## Step 1: Enable the OpenTelemetry Exporter

First, you need to enable telemetry export in your project. Add the `setup-otel-exporter` feature to your `shuttle-runtime` dependency:

```bash
cargo add shuttle-runtime -F setup-otel-exporter
```

The `shuttle-runtime` entry in your project's `Cargo.toml` should now look something like:

```toml
shuttle-runtime = { version = "0.57.0", features = ["setup-otel-exporter"] }
```
> **Note:** Your specific entry may not be *identical*, that's OK. The important part is that `"setup-otel-exporter"` appears in the `features` array.

## Step 2: Choose Your Telemetry Provider

Shuttle supports several telemetry providers. Each has its own setup process:

- [Better Stack](./betterstack) - Recommended for most users
- More providers coming soon!

<Note>
    We plan to expand the list of supported third party services.

## Step 3: Configure Your Provider

Follow the specific guide for your chosen provider to:
1. Create a telemetry source in your provider's dashboard
2. Get your provider's connection details (usually an API key and endpoint)
3. Configure these details in the Shuttle Console

## Step 4: Redeploy Your Project

<Warning>
    **Important**: After configuring telemetry, you **_must_** redeploy your project for the changes to take effect.
    If you made code changes in Step 1 (enabling runtime's OpenTelemetry exporter), you need to make a new deployment using with `shuttle deploy`.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

Once your telemetry is set up, you can:
- [Add custom metrics](./custom-metrics) to your application
- Create dashboards in your provider's interface
- Monitor your application's performance and health
