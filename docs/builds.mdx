Shuttle builds run on AWS CodeBuild, where we compile your Rust app and place it in a Shuttle `runtime` Debian-based Docker image.

## Builder image

The Rust builder image is based on [cargo-chef](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef) to utilize Docker-layer caching of the build dependencies.

### Rust toolchain

The Rust version in the image is regularly updated to the latest stable `stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` toolchain.

By default, the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target is installed, which enables compiling WASM frontends.

### External tools

Apart from what is already found in the Debian-based cargo-chef image [[1]](https://github.com/debuerreotype/docker-debian-artifacts/blob/bfa3d175e4153a23ffb4cf1b573d72408333b4e2/bookworm/rootfs.manifest) [[2]](https://github.com/docker-library/buildpack-deps/blob/fdfe65ea0743aa735b4a5f27cac8e281e43508f5/debian/bookworm/Dockerfile), these `apt` packages are also installed:

- `clang`
- `cmake`
- `llvm-dev`
- `libclang-dev`
- `mold`
- `protobuf-compiler`

Additionally, these tools are installed:

- `cargo-binstall` (latest)
- `trunk` (0.19.2)

## Customize build process

### Feature flags

Use [the "shuttle" feature flag](/docs/project-configuration#cargo-feature-flags) for custom behavior when building on Shuttle.

### Environment variables

The `SHUTTLE=true` env var is set in the builder image.

If you have build flags or env variables that need to be set during compilation, you can add them in `.cargo/config.toml` ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html)) and include it in your deployment. Below are some examples.

```toml .cargo/config.toml
[build]
rustflags = ["--foo", "bar"]

[env]
MY_ENV_VAR = "Shuttle to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀"
```

## Runtime image

The runtime image that your built executable is placed in is a `bookworm-slim` (Debian 12) with `ca-certificates` and `curl` installed.

## (EXPERIMENTAL) Hook scripts

<Warning>This feature is experimental and can change</Warning>

There are three optional bash scripts that can be used to run custom commands during the build.
Create them at the root of your project.

- `shuttle_prebuild.sh`: Runs before `cargo build`. Can be used to install custom build dependencies.
- `shuttle_postbuild.sh`: Runs after `cargo build`.
- `shuttle_setup_container.sh`: Runs in the runtime image before build artifacts are copied into it. Can be used to install custom runtime dependencies.

### Example: Install a custom Rust toolchain

In this example, we install and switch to the `nighlty` toolchain.

```sh shuttle_prebuild.sh
rustup update nightly --profile minimal
rustup default nightly
```

### Example: Install a build dependency

```sh shuttle_prebuild.sh
apt update
apt install -y libopus-dev
```

### Example: Build a WASM frontend

```sh shuttle_postbuild.sh
cd frontend
trunk build --release
```

Note: To use the built static assets at runtime, use [build.assets](/docs/files#build-assets).

### Example: Install a runtime dependency

```sh shuttle_setup_container.sh
apt update
apt install -y ffmpeg
```
