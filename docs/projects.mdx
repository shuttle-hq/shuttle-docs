A Shuttle Project is the main high-level abstraction on the Shuttle platform.
Projects are logical separations of deployments (services), logs, resources, and more.

Deployments to different Shuttle projects run in their own ECS service (Fargate VM), providing a high level of isolation from other projects.

## Project Limits

<Info>
In the free Community Tier, you are limited to 3 projects.
See [Pricing](https://www.shuttle.dev/pricing) for Pro tier benefits, such as more projects.

## Project Name and ID

A Shuttle Project is uniquely identified with its ID, a string starting with `proj_`.
The Shuttle API uses project IDs to identify calls to the project APIs.

The Project Name is an more convenient way to identify your projects.
The name is also part of the default free subdomain your project is hosted on (`https://<project-name>-<nonce>.shuttle.app/`).
The *nonce* (4 random characters) at the end allows multiple users to have projects with the same name.

You can view your project IDs and names with:

```sh
shuttle project list
```

You can rename a project with the following command.
Note: This also updates the default subdomain name.
Custom domains remain unchanged.

```sh
shuttle project update name <new-name>
```

## Project Linking

For the Shuttle CLI to know which Shuttle Project ID to target, it stores the ID in a gitignored config file in your project.
If the ID is not found, it will prompt you to link a project.
You can also re-link the project with one of:

```sh
shuttle project link
shuttle project link --name my-project
shuttle project link --id proj_<ID>
```

## CLI options

When running CLI commands, the project can always be overridden with the `--name` or `--id` options, regardless of which directory you are in.

```bash
# Create a project called `my-project`
shuttle project create --name my-project

# Check the deployment list of `my-project`
shuttle deployment list --name my-project

# View the logs of project with id `proj_01J5AYYKX1WZX51F8GBTH269XB`
shuttle logs --id proj_01J5AYYKX1WZX51F8GBTH269XB
```

## Environments

Multiple environments (such as development, staging, and production) within a project is a planned feature.

Until that feature is ready, you can use a workflow of using one Shuttle project for each environment (for example `project` and `project-dev`).
To deploy to the non-default project name, you can use the `deploy` command with `--name` for targetting a different project, and `--secrets` to use a different secrets file. For example:

```sh
shuttle deploy --name project-dev --secrets Secrets.dev.toml
```
