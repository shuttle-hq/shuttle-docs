Shuttle is ceasing operations. This page outlines what this means for you and what steps you need to take.

## Timeline

**Community tier users:** You have until the **beginning of 2026** to migrate any data before projects and accounts are deleted.

**Pro tier users:** You have until **Jan 16, 2026** to migrate your workloads and data. On that date, all projects will be stopped, and deleted at a later point.

**Growth tier users:** You will receive individual communication with at least one month to migrate, with flexibility to extend if needed.

## Migration options

We recommend migrating to [Neptune](https://www.neptune.dev/), our next-generation platform. Please note that Neptune is currently in beta and may not yet be suitable for all production workloads.

For migrating data out of the Shared Postgres instace, refer to [this page](/guides/migrate-shared-postgres).

Our team is available to assist with migration planning and execution. If you need help, please reach out to us.
