By adding a custom domain to your project, web traffic can be served on your own fancy domain name in addition to the default `<project-name>-<nonce>.shuttle.app`.

You can add a root-level domain (`example.com`) or a subdomain (`thing.example.com`).

Adding a custom domain to your project follows these steps:
- Purchase a domain name from a DNS provider,
- set up a DNS record to make it point to your Shuttle server, and
- generate an SSL certificate that enables HTTPS traffic to your project.

# Set up DNS record

The process for setting up the required DNS rule looks different depending on which type of domain and registrar you have.

## Cloudflare

If you have your domain name on Cloudflare, the process is quite simple. Go to `Websites -> <your domain> -> DNS -> Records -> Add Record`, then follow the relevant section below.

### Root domain

Add a `CNAME` record from `@` to your `*.shuttle.app` subdomain. Disable the Proxy.

Adding a `CNAME` on the root level here is possible due to Cloudflare's [CNAME flattening](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/).

You can also add a `CNAME` for the `www` subdomain if you also want traffic to `www.example.com` to arrive to your service.

### Subdomain

Add a `CNAME` record from your subdomain to your `*.shuttle.app` subdomain. Disable the Proxy.

In the example above, the subdomain `thing` (as in `thing.my-domain.com`) is being directed to `example.shuttle.app`.

## Other DNS providers

The process for other providers can vary, but here are the general steps. If you want to add docs for a specific provider, feel free to contribute to this page.

### Root domain

If you are adding a root-level domain, add one or more `A` records that point to the same IP
addresses that are returned when you do a DNS lookup for your default shuttle domain, e.g.
`example.shuttle.app`.

On Mac or Linux, we can use the `dig` tool in the terminal:
`dig +short A example.shuttle.app`

On Windows you can use `nslookup` in the terminal, or browser based equivalents like
[this](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#A/).

### Subdomain

If you are adding a subdomain, add a `CNAME` record from your subdomain to your `*.shuttle.app` subdomain.

# Set up SSL certificate

Once the DNS records have propagated, add an SSL certificate and start receiving HTTPS traffic by running:

```bash
shuttle certificate add <domain>
```

After that, you can manage certificates with:

```bash
shuttle certificate list
shuttle certificate delete <domain>
```
