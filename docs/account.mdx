To use Shuttle, create an account by signing in to the [Shuttle Console](https://console.shuttle.dev/).

## Login providers

You can create Shuttle accounts with the following authentication providers:

- GitHub
- Google
- Email + password (via Auth0)

Accounts on different providers with matching emails are not automatically linked and are treated as separate accounts.

## Account Tiers

There are four Shuttle account tiers: Community, Pro, Growth, and Enterprise.
Check the [Pricing page](https://www.shuttle.dev/pricing) for more information.

## API Key

A Shuttle account has a single Shuttle API key.

The CLI command `shuttle login` automatically enters the API Key into the CLI configuration after confirming in the browser.

The key can also be retrieved in the Console's [Account Overview](https://console.shuttle.dev/account/overview).

### Reset API Key

To reset the API Key, be logged in and use `shuttle logout --reset-api-key`.
You can then log out of the Shuttle Console and get the new key when logging back in.

## Delete account

To delete your Shuttle account, reach out to [support@shuttle.dev](mailto:support@shuttle.dev).

This action will soon be made possible on the Account settings page.
