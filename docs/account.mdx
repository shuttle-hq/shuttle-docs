To use Shuttle, create an account by signing in to the [Shuttle Console](https://console.shuttle.dev/).

## Login providers

You can create Shuttle accounts with the following authentication providers:

- GitHub
- Google
- Email + password (via Auth0)

Accounts on different providers with matching emails are not automatically linked and are treated as separate accounts.

## Account Tiers

There are three Shuttle account tiers: Pro, Growth, and Enterprise.
Check the [Pricing page](https://www.shuttle.dev/pricing) for more information.

## API Key

A Shuttle account has a single Shuttle API key.
The key can be retrieved in the Console's [Account Overview](https://console.shuttle.dev/account/overview).

The CLI command `shuttle login` automatically enters the API Key into the CLI configuration after confirming in the browser.

### Reset API Key

To reset the API Key, navigate to the Console's [Account Overview](https://console.shuttle.dev/account/overview).

You can also use `shuttle logout --reset-api-key` followed by `shuttle login`.

## Delete account

To delete your Shuttle account, reach out to [support@shuttle.dev](mailto:support@shuttle.dev).

This action will soon be made possible on the Account settings page.

## Community Tier Sunset

<Info>
We're sunsetting the Community tier on Shuttle.

On Friday December 19th, 2025 at 12:00 GMT (UTC+0), all projects on the Community tier will be automatically stopped.

To keep your projects running, please upgrade to Pro. You can also upgrade at any time after Friday to re-deploy your projects.

Project data, such as contents of the Shared Database, will not be deleted. Refer to [this page](/guides/migrate-shared-postgres) if you want to migrate data.

Thank you for building with Shuttle.
