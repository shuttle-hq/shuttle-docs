At Shuttle, you can adjust the vCPU and memory resources allocated to your applicationâ€™s compute environment. The level of scaling available depends on your [Account Tier](/docs/account#account-tiers). This functionality enables you to **vertically scale** your application to better suit your specific performance requirements and workload demands.

<Warning>
Changing the compute type or instance size of your application will result in additional charges. These are calculated according to our [usage-based pricing](/pricing/billing#usage-based-pricing) model. Please ensure you review the pricing details before making adjustments.
</Warning>

### Example

The example below illustrates how to configure your application to use a **medium** instance size:

```rust main.rs
#[shuttle_runtime::main(instance_size = "m")]
async fn main(
) -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    // Your application logic here
}
```

### Available Instance Sizes

The table below lists the available `instance_size` values, along with the corresponding instance type and minimum required Account Tier:

| Instance Size | Value | Account Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Basic** | `xs` | Community+ |
| **Small** | `s` | Pro+ |
| **Medium** | `m` | Pro+ |
| **Large** | `l` | Pro+ |
| **X Large** | `xl` | Pro+ |
| **XX Large** | `xxl` | Growth+ |

_Ensure your selected instance size aligns with your application's current and anticipated workload._
