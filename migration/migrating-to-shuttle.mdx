description: "Short guide on how to migrate your existing project over to Shuttle"

## Setup

<Note>
    This guide assumes that you have Shuttle already setup.
    If you don't, head on over to our [installation](/getting-started/installation) guide.
</Note>

For this example, we'll assume you are migrating an Axum project.

The first step is to add `shuttle-runtime` and `shuttle-axum` to your dependencies to be able to use Shuttle's runtime with the Axum framework.

```bash
cargo add shuttle-runtime shuttle-axum
```

Any [secrets](/resources/shuttle-secrets) you need to use will be kept in a `Secrets.toml` file (dev secrets in `Secrets.dev.toml`) which will be placed at the `Cargo.toml` level.

You can also easily get a provisioned database like so (this example will be for a provisioned PostgreSQL instance specifically):

```bash
cargo add shuttle-shared-db --features postgres
```

If you have any database records you'd like to keep, it would be a good idea to export them so that they can be migrated to the new database.
**You will not need a secrets file if you only need a provisioned Postgres database - this will be automatically be provisioned and given to you in the form of a connection string or an sqlx pool.**

## Migrating your Code

To be able to run your project on Shuttle, you need to make a few changes to your code.
Instead of the `tokio::main` macro, you will use the `shuttle_runtime::main` macro and swap out `dotenvy` for Shuttle's Postgres annotation:

This is what your `main.rs` file looks like before:

```rust main.rs
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    dotenvy::dotenv().ok();

    let url = dotenvy::var("DATABASE_URL").expect("No database URL was set!");

    let pool = sqlx::Pool::connect(&url).await.unwrap();

    sqlx::migrate!()
        .run(&pool)
        .await
        .expect("Migrations failed :(");

    let router = create_api_router(pool);
    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([0, 0, 0, 0], 8000));

    Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(router.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap()
}
```

And this is what it looks like after:

```rust main.rs
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
pub async fn axum (
    #[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] pool: PgPool,
    #[shuttle_runtime::Secrets] secrets: shuttle_runtime::SecretStore,
) -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    sqlx::migrate!()
        .run(&pool)
        .await
        .expect("Migrations failed :(");

    // Use secrets for anything that needs them

    let router = create_api_router(pool);

    Ok(router.into())
}
```

If you need more than a simple router, you'll want to create a custom struct that holds all of your required app state information inside and then create an `impl` for the struct - you can find more about that [here.](https://docs.shuttle.rs/tutorials/custom-service) Anything outside of your entry point function (the function that uses the `shuttle_runtime::main` macro) doesn't need to be changed. If you are using secrets as well as a database connection, you may wish to create a struct that holds both of these values and then pass it into the function that generates the router.

## Deploying

To ensure that you get a unique project name, create a `Shuttle.toml` file at the `Cargo.toml` level to name your project to whatever you like.

```toml
name = "my-unique-app-name-here"
```

Now all you need to do is to run the following commands:

```bash
cargo shuttle project start
cargo shuttle project deploy
```

Your project should now be deployed!
