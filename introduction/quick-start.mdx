title: "Quick Start"
---

We will assume that you have already installed shuttle. If you haven't, you can
take a look on how to in our [installation](introduction/installation) section.

In order to get started quickly, we will be using `axum` for this example.

To initialize your project, simply write:

```sh
cargo shuttle init --axum hello-world
```

And to deploy it, write:

```sh
cargo shuttle deploy And that's... it.
```

Feel free to build on-top of the generated `hello-world` example or take a stab
at one of our [examples](examples/axum).
