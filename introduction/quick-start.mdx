We will assume that you have already installed shuttle. If you haven't, you can
take a look on how to in our [installation](installation) section.

To initialize your project, simply write:

```sh
cargo shuttle init
```

If you didn't create the project environment in the init command, run:

```sh
cargo shuttle project new
```

And to deploy it:

```sh
cargo shuttle deploy
```

Or try it out locally (local runs with databases require [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)):
```sh
cargo shuttle run
```
And that's... it.

Feel free to build on-top of the generated `hello-world` example or take a stab
at one of our [examples](../examples/axum).
