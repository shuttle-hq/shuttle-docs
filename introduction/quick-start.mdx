title: "Quick Start"

We will assume that you have already installed shuttle. If you haven't, you should
check out our [installation](./installation) section. To run commands with the shuttle
command line interface (`cargo shuttle`), you'll also need to [install protoc](../support/installing-protoc).

To initialize your project, simply write:

```sh
cargo shuttle init
```

If you didn't create the project environment in the init command, run:

```sh
cargo shuttle project new
```

And to deploy it:

```sh
cargo shuttle deploy
```

*In case you haven't commited the changes of your project to your repo, you'll have to add a `--allow-dirty` flag.*

You can also run your project locally for development, check out our [local run](./local-run) section.

Feel free to build on-top of the generated `hello-world` example or take a stab
at one of our [examples](../examples/axum).
