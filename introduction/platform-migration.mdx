This guide is for migration old projects from **shuttle.rs** to the new **shuttle.dev** platform.
If you are a new Shuttle user, you can ignore this document and start from [Installation](/getting-started/installation).

## 1. Check platform features & policies

<Warning>
Due to the large re-write of the Shuttle platform, some features have been dropped or moved to the feature roadmap.

Make sure you have read the [Platform Update Changelog](/introduction/platform-update#changelog) to verify that it is currently possible to migrate your project.
Notably:

- Migrating **Shuttle Persist** is not currently possible as there is no drop-in replacement yet.
We plan to add one soon.

- Migrating **Shared MongoDB** is not possible since the feature has been dropped.

- If you use a **Shuttle AWS RDS** on **shuttle.rs** and want to migrate, please reach out to us.
</Warning>

## 2. Update CLI

Follow [Installation](/getting-started/installation) to install the latest Shuttle CLI.

<Snippet file="binaries.mdx" />

<Note>
The same Shuttle API key is used on both platforms. If you are already logged in, you don't need to `shuttle login` again.
</Note>

To verify that your new CLI is installed and working correctly, try the new account command:

```sh
shuttle account
```

If the command does not error, you are ready to use **shuttle.dev**.

## 3. Access the new Console

The Shuttle Console for **shuttle.dev** is now accessed at [console.shuttle.dev](https://console.shuttle.dev/).

The Shuttle Console for **shuttle.rs** is still accessed at [console.shuttle.rs](https://console.shuttle.rs/).

## 4. Update Code

Most Shuttle projects should run on the new platform with minimal code changes.
This is the list of required changes.

### Cargo.toml

Update to the latest version of Shuttle dependencies:

```toml Cargo.toml
shuttle-runtime = "0.48.0"
# do the same for all other shuttle crates
# for example, if you use `shuttle-axum`:
shuttle-axum = "0.48.0"
```

### Shuttle.toml

The `name` field is now unused.

The `assets` field has been renamed to `deploy.include` ([docs](/docs/files#include-ignored-files)).

If you want the deploy command to keep blocking dirty deployments, add the `deploy.deny_dirty` field ([docs](/docs/files#block-dirty-deployments)).

If your project uses static assets at runtime, you need to declare them in `build.assets` to have them copied from the builder to the runtime image ([docs](/docs/files#build-assets)).

### Secrets.toml

Secrets.toml must now be in the root of the cargo workspace, so move it there if it is in a member crate.

`--secrets <file>` on the deploy command can still be used for a custom secrets file location.

## 5. Local Run

Check that your project builds and runs locally with

```sh
shuttle run
```

## 6. Deploy

Time to deploy!

```sh
shuttle deploy
```

Note your project URL: project subdomains are now under `*.shuttle.app` instead of `*.shuttleapp.rs`.

## 7. (Optional) Migrate Shared Postgres data

<Note>
We are currently working on a way to dump the data in a shared Postgres, so that it can be restored in a shared Postgres on the shuttle.dev platform.
Stay tuned!
</Note>

## 8. (Optional) Update GitHub Action

If you are using [deploy-action](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/deploy-action), check the new v2 branch for renamed and new required fields:

- Use `shuttle-hq/deploy-action@v2` instead of `shuttle-hq/deploy-action@main`
- Rename `deploy-key` to `shuttle-api-key`
- Add a `project-id` value
- Any other args can be added in `extra-args`

## 9. (Optional) Custom domains

Once you have moved resources, deployed your app to shuttle.dev, and want to move your custom domain, update your DNS records according to [Domain names](/docs/domain-names) and use the new `shuttle certificate` command to add SSL certificates.
HTTPS traffic should then be enabled for your custom domain.
