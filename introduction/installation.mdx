Shuttle provides pre-built binaries of the `cargo-shuttle` CLI with every release
for most platforms, they can be found on [our github](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases/latest).

Our binaries can also be installed using [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall), 
which will automatically install the correct target for your system. to install with
`cargo-binstall`, run:

```
cargo binstall cargo-shuttle
```

While it will be a bit slower you can also install directly with cargo, but first you
need to install `protoc`, check out our [protoc installation guide](../support/installing-protoc).

Then, run:

```sh
cargo install cargo-shuttle
```

And then login:

```sh
cargo shuttle login
```

Once you've done this, you are good to go! To get up and running, proceed to our
[Quick Start](./quick-start) page!
