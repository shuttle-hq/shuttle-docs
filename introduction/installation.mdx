## Prerequisites

To run a shuttle project, you need to install `protoc`, check out our [protoc installation guide](../support/installing-protoc).

## Install shuttle

The `cargo-shuttle` CLI can be installed with a pre-built binary or from source with cargo.

### Pre-built binary

Shuttle provides pre-built binaries of the `cargo-shuttle` CLI with every release
for most platforms, they can be found on [our GitHub](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases/latest).

Our binaries can also be installed using [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall),
which will automatically install the correct target for your system.
To install with `cargo-binstall`, run:

```sh
cargo binstall cargo-shuttle
```

### From source

Although a bit slower, you can also install directly with cargo:

```sh
cargo install cargo-shuttle
```

## Login

After installing, log in with:

```sh
cargo shuttle login
```

Once you've done this, you are good to go!
To get up and running, proceed to our [Quick Start](./quick-start) page!
