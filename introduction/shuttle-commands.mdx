## Overview

Interaction with the shuttle services is through the Command Line Interface (CLI).
A combination of commands, and sub-commands, each with options, allow a variety of management tasks to be performed.

Any given command is issued in the format: `cargo shuttle [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>`

To get an overview of available commands and any available options, run:

```bash
cargo shuttle help
```

## Options

*Tip: Options are entered in the format: `--name`, as an example.*

Options can be passed in with commands to customize a command's, or a sub-command's, behaviour.

## Commands

*Tip: Run a command with the `--help` flag to see available subcommands*
