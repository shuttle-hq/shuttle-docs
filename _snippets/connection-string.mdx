### Connection string

After deploying a project with a database macro, you can view the connection string with credentials with:

```bash
cargo shuttle resource list --show-secrets
```

Using the connection string, you can connect to it for manual querying, inspection, and migration.
You can also export/import data using a dump tool suitable for the database of choice.
