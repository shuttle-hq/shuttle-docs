description: In Q4 2024, Shuttle launched a new and improved platform
---

Introducing the new Shuttle platform! We've supercharged what developers love about Shuttle, combining our powerful developer experience with enterprise-grade infrastructure. For developers, we've kept it simple and intuitive - no complex configs, just focus on your Rust code. On the production side, we've implemented VM-level isolation, increased reliability and scalability to meet real-world demands. From solo developers to enterprise teams, Shuttle now offers the perfect blend of ease and production-ready robustness.

## Important Dates

- January 2nd, 2025: Deployment freeze on legacy platform
- January 14th, 2025: Legacy platform shutdown begins (gradual shutdown and removal of all projects)
- January 31st, 2025: Complete decommissioning of legacy platform infrastructure

Migrate to the new platform for continued deployment capabilities. Check out our [migration docs](/platform-update/migration).

## Domain and CLI changes

### Access the NEW platform

- New Console: [console.shuttle.dev](https://console.shuttle.dev)
- New Docs: [docs.shuttle.dev](https://docs.shuttle.dev)
- Command Line: new `shuttle` command (installed alongside `cargo shuttle`)

### ~~Access the OLD platform~~ (no longer available)

- ~~Old Console: [console.shuttle.rs](https://console.shuttle.rs)~~
- ~~Old Docs: [docs.shuttle.rs](https://docs.shuttle.rs)~~
- ~~Command Line: `cargo shuttle`~~

## Changelog

### Changed

- ⚠️ The Shuttle Console is located at [console.shuttle.dev](https://console.shuttle.dev/) instead of **console.shuttle.rs**.
- ⚠️ Project subdomains are under `*.shuttle.app` instead of `*.shuttleapp.rs`
- ⚠️ A new binary `shuttle` is now provided for using the new platform ([read more](/getting-started/installation)).
- Project names are no longer globally unique, only unique per account. Project URLs now have some random characters at the end of its default subdomain, e.g. `myproject-3h5n.shuttle.app`.
- Builds and deployments are now fully separated. This allows for more specialised build workflows, and more efficient deployment hosting.
  - Builds run on AWS CodeBuild, and now produce a Docker image instead of just a binary. *This implies we can support more languages than Rust in the future. ✨*
  - Deployments run on AWS ECS with Fargate.
- CLI commands:
  - `deploy`: no longer runs tests, so `--no-test` has no effect.
  - `deploy`: no longer denies dirty deployments by default ([read more](/docs/files#block-dirty-deployments)).
  - `status`: use `deployment status` instead.
  - `stop`: use `deployment stop` instead.
  - `project status`: projects no longer have a state, so `--follow` has no effect.
  - `login`: automatically gets the API key from the API after an approval in Shuttle Console. No more copy + pasting!
- Max archive size for deployments is now 100 MB (up from 50MB).
- Secrets.toml must now be in the root of the cargo workspace (`--secrets <file>` can still be used for a custom location).
- Shuttle.toml:
  - Renamed the `assets` field to `deploy.include` ([read more](/docs/files#include-ignored-files)).
  - For static files to move from the build stage to the runtime container, you must specify `build.assets` ([read more](/docs/files#build-assets)).
- Shared Postgres resource:
  - Postgres 16
  - Now based on AWS RDS
  - Now has common [Postgres Extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/PostgreSQLReleaseNotes/postgresql-extensions.html#postgresql-extensions-16x)

### Added

- The Shuttle proxy, that proxies HTTP requests to user projects, now sets the [X-Forwarded-For header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For) on all requests, with the IP of the original caller.
- CLI commands:
  - Commands that target a project: You will now be prompted to link your project directory to a Shuttle project.
  - In addition to `--name <name>`, you can also use `--id <id>` to target specific projects. This overrides project linking.
  - `project link`: explicitly re-link the project directory to a Shuttle project.
  - `certificate` command for adding and managing SSL certificates for custom domains.
  - `deploy --no-follow` to not poll the deployment status until it reaches a running or failed state.
  - `account` to show information about your account.
  - `project update name` to rename a project.
- You can now create accounts with Google sign-in and email + password. Accounts on new providers with matching emails are not linked and are treated as separate accounts.
- The ability to increase the allocated CPU and RAM limits (contact us).

### Removed

- **Shuttle Persist** resource and the persistent file volume. *(We plan to implement an S3-based replacement.)*
- **MongoDB Shared Database** resource. *(Removed due to having very few users.)*
- **AWS RDS Database** resource. *(We plan to bring it back.)*
- CLI commands:
  - `project stop`
  - `project restart`
  - `clean`
- The **Teams** feature has been temporarily disabled. We plan to enable it after improvements have been made.

{/* ## Upcoming features

Not all planned features are implemented yet. Here is a list of planned changes:

- Full HTTP/2 support
- Feature parity between CLI and Shuttle Console
- Project idling or other way to reduce compute costs
- Customising CPU and RAM for the builder and runtime containers
- Deploying prebuilt shuttle-examples docker images (allows one-click deploys)
- Streaming logs with `shuttle logs --follow` and during a `deploy` command
- New resources, such as S3 bucket */}
