## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will have built a **Discord Weather Bot** and learned how to:

- Register and configure a Discord bot application
- Build a Discord bot using the Serenity library
- Integrate with external APIs (OpenWeatherMap)
- Handle Discord slash commands and responses
- Deploy your bot to run 24/7 in the cloud
- Manage API keys and secrets securely

## Prerequisites

- Basic Rust knowledge (structs, async/await, error handling)
- [Shuttle CLI installed](/getting-started/installation)
- A Discord account and access to a Discord server where you can test
- Basic familiarity with Discord (what bots are, how commands work)

**Time Required**: 45-60 minutes

## What We're Building

We'll create a Discord bot that responds to the `/weather <city>` command by fetching real-time weather data and posting a formatted forecast to Discord. Users will be able to get current weather conditions for any city worldwide.

The bot will:

- Respond to `/weather` slash commands
- Fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Format and display temperature, conditions, and humidity
- Handle errors gracefully (invalid cities, API failures)
- Run continuously in the cloud

## Step 1: Register Your Discord Bot

First, we need to create a Discord application and bot.

**Create a Discord Application**:

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application"
3. Name it "Weather Bot" (or your preferred name)
4. Click "Create"

![Discord Create Application](/images/discord-weather-forecast-1.png)

You should see your application dashboard. **Copy the Application ID** - we'll need it later.

![Application Dashboard](/images/discord-weather-forecast-2.png)

**What to notice**: The Application ID uniquely identifies your bot application. This is different from the bot token we'll get next.

**Create the Bot**:

1. Click "Bot" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Add Bot" then "Yes, do it!"
3. Set a username for your bot (this appears in Discord)
4. Click "Reset Token" and copy the bot token that appears

![Bot Configuration](/images/discord-weather-forecast-3.png)

**Important**: Keep this token secret! This is like a password for your bot.

**What to notice**: The bot token authenticates your code with Discord. Anyone with this token can control your bot.

## Step 2: Add Bot to Your Discord Server

Now let's add the bot to a Discord server for testing.

**Generate Invite URL**:

Replace `<application_id>` with your Application ID from Step 1:

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<application_id>&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=2048
```

**Add to Server**:

1. Open the URL in your browser
2. Select a Discord server you can manage
3. Click "Continue" then "Authorize"

Your bot should now appear in your Discord server, but it will be offline:

![Bot Offline](/images/discord-weather-forecast-4.png)

**What to notice**: The bot shows as offline because we haven't written any code yet. Once we deploy our code, it will show as online.

## Step 3: Create Your Shuttle Project

Create a new Shuttle project with the Serenity template:

```bash
shuttle init --template serenity weather-bot
cd weather-bot
```

Examine the generated code:

```bash
cat src/main.rs
```

You'll see a basic Discord bot that responds to `!hello`:

```rust
use anyhow::Context as _;
use serenity::async_trait;
use serenity::model::channel::Message;
use serenity::model::gateway::Ready;
use serenity::prelude::*;
use shuttle_runtime::SecretStore;
use tracing::{error, info};

struct Bot;

#[async_trait]
impl EventHandler for Bot {
    async fn message(&self, ctx: Context, msg: Message) {
        if msg.content == "!hello" {
            if let Err(e) = msg.channel_id.say(&ctx.http, "world!").await {
                error!("Error sending message: {:?}", e);
            }
        }
    }

    async fn ready(&self, _: Context, ready: Ready) {
        info!("{} is connected!", ready.user.name);
    }
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(#[shuttle_runtime::Secrets] secrets: SecretStore) -> shuttle_serenity::ShuttleSerenity {
    // Get the discord token set in `Secrets.toml`
    let token = secrets.get("DISCORD_TOKEN")
        .context("'DISCORD_TOKEN' was not found")?;

    let intents = GatewayIntents::GUILD_MESSAGES
        | GatewayIntents::DIRECT_MESSAGES
        | GatewayIntents::MESSAGE_CONTENT;

    let client = Client::builder(&token, intents)
        .event_handler(Bot)
        .await
        .expect("Err creating client");

    Ok(client.into())
}
```

**What to notice**: This bot uses the `EventHandler` trait to respond to Discord events. It needs a `DISCORD_TOKEN` secret to authenticate.

## Step 4: Configure Your Bot Token

Create a `Secrets.toml` file in your project root:

```bash
touch Secrets.toml
```

Add your bot token to `Secrets.toml`:

```toml
DISCORD_TOKEN = "your_bot_token_from_step_1"
```

**Important**: Add `Secrets.toml` to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets:

```bash
echo "Secrets.toml" >> .gitignore
```

Test your basic bot:

```bash
shuttle run
```

You should see output like:

```
Weather Bot is connected!
```

Your bot should now show as online in Discord! Try typing `!hello` in a channel - it should respond with "world!".

**What to notice**: The bot is now running locally and connected to Discord. The `shuttle run` command automatically loads secrets and starts your bot.

## Step 5: Get Weather API Access

We'll use OpenWeatherMap for weather data.

**Create OpenWeatherMap Account**:

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to "API keys" in your account
4. Copy your API key

**Add Weather API Key**:

Update your `Secrets.toml`:

```toml
DISCORD_TOKEN = "your_bot_token_from_step_1"
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "your_openweather_api_key"
```

**What to notice**: OpenWeatherMap's free tier allows 1,000 API calls per day, which is plenty for a personal Discord bot.

## Step 6: Add Dependencies for Weather Features

Update your `Cargo.toml` to include HTTP client and JSON parsing:

```toml
[package]
name = "weather-bot"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
anyhow = "1.0"
serenity = { version = "0.12", default-features = false, features = ["client", "gateway", "rustls_backend", "model"] }
shuttle-runtime = "0.56.0"
shuttle-serenity = "0.56.0"
tokio = "1.28"
tracing = "0.1"
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

Build to download dependencies:

```bash
cargo build
```

**What to notice**: We've added `reqwest` for HTTP requests and `serde` for JSON parsing to interact with the weather API.

## Step 7: Create Weather Data Structures

Create `src/weather.rs` for weather-related code:

```rust
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
pub struct WeatherResponse {
    pub weather: Vec<WeatherCondition>,
    pub main: MainWeather,
    pub name: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
pub struct WeatherCondition {
    pub main: String,
    pub description: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
pub struct MainWeather {
    pub temp: f64,
    pub humidity: u32,
    pub feels_like: f64,
}

impl WeatherResponse {
    pub fn to_celsius(&self) -> i32 {
        (self.main.temp - 273.15) as i32
    }

    pub fn feels_like_celsius(&self) -> i32 {
        (self.main.feels_like - 273.15) as i32
    }

    pub fn format_response(&self) -> String {
        let condition = &self.weather[0];
        format!(
            "🌤️ **Weather in {}**\n🌡️ Temperature: {}°C (feels like {}°C)\n☁️ Conditions: {}\n💧 Humidity: {}%",
            self.name,
            self.to_celsius(),
            self.feels_like_celsius(),
            condition.description,
            self.main.humidity
        )
    }
}

pub async fn get_weather(city: &str, api_key: &str) -> Result<WeatherResponse, reqwest::Error> {
    let url = format!(
        "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={}&appid={}",
        city, api_key
    );

    let response = reqwest::get(&url).await?;
    let weather: WeatherResponse = response.json().await?;
    Ok(weather)
}
```

Test it compiles:

```bash
cargo check
```

**What to notice**: We parse OpenWeatherMap's JSON response into Rust structs and convert temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius for easier reading.

## Step 8: Implement Slash Commands

Now let's replace the basic message handler with modern Discord slash commands. Update `src/main.rs`:

```rust
mod weather;

use anyhow::Context as _;
use serenity::async_trait;
use serenity::builder::{CreateCommand, CreateInteractionResponse, CreateInteractionResponseMessage};
use serenity::model::application::{Interaction, InteractionResponseType};
use serenity::model::gateway::Ready;
use serenity::model::id::GuildId;
use serenity::prelude::*;
use shuttle_runtime::SecretStore;
use tracing::{error, info};
use weather::get_weather;

struct Bot {
    weather_api_key: String,
}

#[async_trait]
impl EventHandler for Bot {
    async fn interaction_create(&self, ctx: Context, interaction: Interaction) {
        if let Interaction::ApplicationCommand(command) = interaction {
            let response_content = match command.data.name.as_str() {
                "weather" => {
                    let city = command.data.options[0].value.as_ref()
                        .and_then(|v| v.as_str())
                        .unwrap_or("London");

                    match get_weather(city, &self.weather_api_key).await {
                        Ok(weather) => weather.format_response(),
                        Err(_) => format!("❌ Sorry, I couldn't find weather data for '{}'", city),
                    }
                }
                _ => "❓ Unknown command".to_string(),
            };

            let data = CreateInteractionResponseMessage::new().content(response_content);
            let builder = CreateInteractionResponse::Message(data);

            if let Err(why) = command.create_interaction_response(&ctx.http, builder).await {
                error!("Cannot respond to slash command: {}", why);
            }
        }
    }

    async fn ready(&self, ctx: Context, ready: Ready) {
        info!("{} is connected!", ready.user.name);

        let commands = [
            CreateCommand::new("weather")
                .description("Get weather forecast for a city")
                .add_option(
                    serenity::builder::CreateCommandOption::new(
                        serenity::model::application::CommandOptionType::String,
                        "city",
                        "City name"
                    ).required(true)
                )
        ];

        let commands = ready.user.id.global_commands(&ctx.http, commands).await;

        match commands {
            Ok(_) => info!("Registered slash commands"),
            Err(why) => error!("Failed to register slash commands: {}", why),
        }
    }
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(#[shuttle_runtime::Secrets] secrets: SecretStore) -> shuttle_serenity::ShuttleSerenity {
    let token = secrets.get("DISCORD_TOKEN")
        .context("'DISCORD_TOKEN' was not found")?;

    let weather_api_key = secrets.get("OPENWEATHER_API_KEY")
        .context("'OPENWEATHER_API_KEY' was not found")?;

    let intents = GatewayIntents::empty();

    let client = Client::builder(&token, intents)
        .event_handler(Bot { weather_api_key })
        .await
        .expect("Err creating client");

    Ok(client.into())
}
```

Build your updated bot:

```bash
cargo build
```

**What to notice**: Slash commands are Discord's modern way to interact with bots. They provide a better user experience with autocomplete and validation.

## Step 9: Test Your Weather Bot

Run your bot locally:

```bash
shuttle run
```

You should see:

```
Weather Bot is connected!
Registered slash commands
```

**Test the weather command**:

1. Go to your Discord server
2. Type `/weather` - you should see the command appear
3. Type a city name like "Paris" and press Enter

Your bot should respond with formatted weather information!

Try different cities:

- `/weather Tokyo`
- `/weather New York`
- `/weather InvalidCity123` (should show error message)

**What to notice**: The bot fetches real-time weather data and formats it nicely with emojis. Error handling ensures the bot doesn't crash on invalid cities.

## Step 10: Deploy Your Bot to Production

Deploy your bot to run 24/7 in the cloud:

```bash
shuttle deploy
```

This will take a few minutes to build and deploy. You'll see output like:

```
Deployment finished successfully.
Service Name:  weather-bot
Status:        running
```

Your bot is now running in production! Test it again in Discord - it should work the same way, but now it's running in the cloud instead of your local machine.

**What to notice**: Shuttle automatically handled deploying your bot, managing secrets, and keeping it running continuously.

## Step 11: Verify Production Deployment

Your bot should now be online 24/7. Test thoroughly:

**Basic functionality**:

- `/weather London` - should return current weather
- `/weather` without a city - should default to London
- `/weather XYZ123` - should handle invalid cities gracefully

**Monitor your bot**:

- Check that the bot shows as "Online" in Discord
- Try commands from different channels
- Test with multiple users

**View logs** (if needed):

```bash
shuttle logs
```

**What to notice**: Your bot is now a production service that will stay online even when you close your laptop!

## Troubleshooting

**Bot appears offline?**

- Check that `DISCORD_TOKEN` in `Secrets.toml` is correct
- Verify the bot has proper permissions in your Discord server
- Check logs with `shuttle logs`

**Slash commands not appearing?**

- Wait a few minutes - Discord can take time to register commands
- Make sure the bot has "applications.commands" scope
- Try kicking and re-inviting the bot

**Weather commands returning errors?**

- Verify `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` in `Secrets.toml` is correct
- Check that you haven't exceeded the free API limit (1,000 calls/day)
- Test with common city names first

**Build errors?**

- Ensure all dependencies in `Cargo.toml` match Step 6
- Check that `src/weather.rs` was created properly
- Try `cargo clean && cargo build`

**"Secrets not found" errors?**

- Make sure `Secrets.toml` exists in your project root
- Verify the secret names match exactly (`DISCORD_TOKEN`, `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`)
- Check that `Secrets.toml` is not in `.gitignore` during local development

You've successfully learned how to build and deploy Discord bots with Rust and Shuttle!
