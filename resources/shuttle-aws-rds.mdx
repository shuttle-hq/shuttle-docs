title: "Shuttle AWS RDS"
---

<Snippet file="pro-feature.mdx" />

This plugin provisions databases on AWS RDS using [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs). The following engines are supported:
- Postgres
- MySql
- MariaDB

{/* TODO: Write more about the advantages of RDS vs shared */}
The RDS instance created by Shuttle has the following specifications and features by default:
- 2 vCPU
- 1 GB Memory
- 20 GiB Storage
- Backups Disabled
- Single Availability Zone
- 1 Node
- No Proxy

The pricing of this instance can be found in the Pro Add-ons section of the [pricing page](https://www.shuttle.rs/pricing).

If you require a different configuration, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/shuttle) or email us at hello@shuttle.rs. We can provision any size or configuration of RDS to suit your needs - a full list of RDS features can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/)

Shuttle makes sure that any data stored in your provisioned database is stored permanently and will persist if you redeploy your server via `cargo shuttle deploy`, as well as if you restart your service via `cargo shuttle project restart`.

## Usage
Add `shuttle-aws-rds` to the dependencies for your service.
Each type of database is behind the following feature flag and attribute path. `*-rustls` feature enables `rustls`-based implementation, otherwise some flavour of `native-tls` is used.

| Engine   | Feature flags | Attribute path | Return type |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Postgres | `postgres` or `postgres-rustls` | shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres | `sqlx::PgPool` |
| MySql    | `mysql` or `mysql-rustls` | shuttle_aws_rds::MySql | `sqlx::MySqlPool` |
| MariaDB  | `mariadb` or `mariadb-rustls` | shuttle_aws_rds::MariaDB | `sqlx::MySqlPool` |

### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| local_uri | str  | `None`  | If specified, on local runs, connect to this database instead of starting a Docker container for it. |

When setting the `local_uri` you can also insert secrets from `Secrets.toml` using string interpolation. To insert the
`PASSWORD` secret, pass it in like this:

```rust
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn tide(
    #[shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres(
        local_uri = "postgres://postgres:{secrets.PASSWORD}@localhost:16695/postgres"
    )] pool: PgPool,
) -> ShuttleTide<MyState> { ... }
```

<Note>If you are interpolating a secret from `Secrets.dev.toml`, you need to set the same secret in `Secrets.toml` to a empty string so that this step does not crash in deployment.</Note>

The URI should be formatted according to the
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) or
[MySql and MariaDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.html#connecting-using-uri)
documentation, depending on which one you're using.

If you do not specify a `local_uri`, then cargo-shuttle will attempt to spin up a Docker container and launch the database inside of it.
For this to succeed, you must have Docker installed and you must also have started the Docker engine. If you have not used Docker
before, the easiest way is to [install the desktop app](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and then launch it in order to start
the Docker engine.

## Example

This snippet shows the main function of a tide app that uses the `shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres` attribute to provision an RDS Postgres database.
It gives you an authenticated [sqlx Pool](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/pool/index.html), which you can use to interact with the database.

```rust main.rs
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn tide(#[shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres] pool: PgPool) -> ShuttleTide<MyState> {
    pool.execute(include_str!("../schema.sql"))
        .await
        .map_err(CustomError::new)?;

    let state = MyState { pool };
    let mut app = tide::with_state(state);

    app.with(tide::log::LogMiddleware::new());
    app.at("/todo").post(add);
    app.at("/todo/:id").get(retrieve);

    Ok(app.into())
}
```
