<Snippet file="pro-feature.mdx" />

This plugin provisions AWS RDS databases on [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs). The following engines are supported:
- Postgres
- MySql
- MariaDB

## RDS vs Shared DB

- Dedicated Instance: Each instance of AWS RDS is it's own dedicated instance.
- Stability and Security: AWS RDS has greater stability due to it being a service directly offered by AWS, and also greater security due to being a dedicated instance.
- Flexible: AWS RDS instances on the Shuttle platform can be customised to suit your needs. Instance size can be increased from the default and AWS RDS features can be enabled or disabled.

On *AWS RDS* we offer:
- MariaDB
- MySQL
- Postgres

With the *Shared DB* we offer:
- MongoDB
- Postgres

## Default RDS Instance
The RDS instance created by Shuttle has the following specifications and features by default:
- 2 vCPU
- 1 GB Memory
- 20 GiB Storage
- Backups Disabled
- Single Availability Zone
- 1 Node
- No Proxy

The pricing of this instance can be found in the Pro Add-ons section of the [pricing page](https://www.shuttle.rs/pricing).

If you require a different configuration, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/shuttle) or email us at hello@shuttle.rs. We can provision any size or configuration of RDS to suit your needs - a full list of RDS features can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/)

Shuttle makes sure that any data stored in your provisioned database is stored permanently and will persist if you redeploy your server via `cargo shuttle deploy`, as well as if you restart your service via `cargo shuttle project restart`.

## Usage

This plugin is used identically to [Shuttle Shared DB](./shuttle-shared-db) with the following differences:

- Use the crate `shuttle-aws-rds` instead of `shuttle-shared-db`.
- The feature flags for each engine are `postgres`, `mysql`, and `mariadb`.
- If you add the `sqlx` flag for MySQL or MariaDB, the output type is `sqlx::MySqlPool`.

## Example

This snippet shows the main function of a tide app that uses the `#[shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres]` attribute macro to provision an RDS Postgres database.
It gives you an authenticated [sqlx Pool](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/pool/index.html), which you can use to interact with the database.

```rust main.rs
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn tide(#[shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres] pool: PgPool) -> ShuttleTide<MyState> {
    pool.execute(include_str!("../schema.sql"))
        .await
        .map_err(CustomError::new)?;

    let state = MyState { pool };
    let mut app = tide::with_state(state);

    app.with(tide::log::LogMiddleware::new());
    app.at("/todo").post(add);
    app.at("/todo/:id").get(retrieve);

    Ok(app.into())
}
```
