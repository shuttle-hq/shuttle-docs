This plugin provisions AWS RDS databases on [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs). The following engines are supported:
- Postgres
- MySQL
- MariaDB

## RDS vs Shared DB

- Dedicated Instance: Each instance of AWS RDS is it's own dedicated instance.
- Stability and Security: AWS RDS has greater stability due to it being a service directly offered by AWS, and also greater security due to being a dedicated instance.
- Flexible: AWS RDS instances on the Shuttle platform can be customised to suit your needs. Instance size can be increased from the default and AWS RDS features can be enabled or disabled.

On *AWS RDS* we offer:
- Postgres
- MySQL
- MariaDB

With the *Shared DB* we offer:
- Postgres
- MongoDB

## Default RDS Instance

The RDS instance created by Shuttle has the following specifications and features by default:
- 2 vCPU
- 1 GB Memory
- 20 GiB Storage
- Backups Disabled
- Single Availability Zone
- 1 Node
- No Proxy

The pricing of this instance can be found on our [pricing page](https://www.shuttle.rs/pricing).

If you require a different configuration, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/shuttle) or email us at hello@shuttle.rs. We can provision any size or configuration of RDS to suit your needs - a full list of RDS features can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/)

Shuttle makes sure that any data stored in your provisioned database is stored permanently and will persist if you redeploy your server via `cargo shuttle deploy`, as well as if you restart your service via `cargo shuttle project restart`.

## Usage

Start by adding `shuttle-aws-rds` to the dependencies for your service.
Each type of database is behind its own feature flag and macro attribute path.

| Engine   | Feature flag | Attribute path |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Postgres | `postgres`   | `shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres` |
| MySQL    | `mysql`      | `shuttle_aws_rds::MySql` |
| MariaDB  | `mariadb`    | `shuttle_aws_rds::MariaDB` |

### Output type

By default, you can get the connection string to the database and connect to it with your preferred library.
You can also specify other return types to get rid of common boilerplate.

Depending on which type declaration is used as the output type in the macro, you might need to activate additional feature flags:

| Engine   | Feature flag | Type declaration | Description |
|----------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| Any | | `String` | The connection string including username and password |
| Postgres | `sqlx` (with rustls) or `sqlx-native-tls` | `sqlx::PgPool` | An sqlx connection pool with reasonable defaults |
| MySQL | `sqlx` (with rustls) or `sqlx-native-tls` | `sqlx::MySqlPool` | An sqlx connection pool with reasonable defaults |
| MariaDB | `sqlx` (with rustls) or `sqlx-native-tls` | `sqlx::MySqlPool` | An sqlx connection pool with reasonable defaults |

Lastly, add a macro annotaion to the Shuttle main function. Here are examples for Postgres:

```rust
// Use the connection string
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(#[shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres] conn_str: String) -> ... { ... }

// With sqlx feature flag, get a PgPool connected automatically
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(#[shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres] pool: sqlx::PgPool) -> ... { ... }
```

### Parameters

All of the AWS RDS macros take the same optional parameter:

| Parameter     | Type | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| local_uri     | &str | If specified, on local runs, use this database instead of starting a Docker container for it |
| database_name | &str | Name to give the default database. Defaults to project name if none is given                 |

When passing in strings, you can also insert secrets from `Secrets.toml` using string interpolation.
To insert the `PASSWORD` secret, pass it in like this:

```rust
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(
    #[shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres(
        local_uri = "postgres://postgres:{secrets.PASSWORD}@localhost:16695/postgres"
    )] conn_str: String,
) -> ... { ... }
```

<Note>Caveat: If you are interpolating a secret from `Secrets.dev.toml`, you need to set the same secret in `Secrets.toml` to a empty string so that this step does not crash in deployment.</Note>

The URI should be formatted according to the
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) or
[MySql and MariaDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.html#connecting-using-uri)
documentation, depending on which one you're using.

If you do not specify a `local_uri`, then cargo-shuttle will attempt to spin up a Docker container and launch the database inside of it.
For this to succeed, you must have Docker installed and you must also have started the Docker engine. If you have not used Docker
before, the easiest way is to [install the desktop app](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and then launch it in order to start
the Docker engine.

## Example

This snippet shows the main function of a tide app that uses the `#[shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres]` attribute macro to provision an RDS Postgres database.
It gives you an authenticated [sqlx Pool](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/pool/index.html), which you can use to interact with the database.

```rust main.rs
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn tide(#[shuttle_aws_rds::Postgres] pool: PgPool) -> ShuttleTide<MyState> {
    pool.execute(include_str!("../schema.sql"))
        .await
        .map_err(CustomError::new)?;

    let state = MyState { pool };
    let mut app = tide::with_state(state);

    app.with(tide::log::LogMiddleware::new());
    app.at("/todo").post(add);
    app.at("/todo/:id").get(retrieve);

    Ok(app.into())
}
```
