This plugin allows services to connect to a [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) database. Qdrant is a vector database & vector similarity search engine.

You can get started in seconds by cloning our Axum + Qdrant example with

```bash
cargo shuttle init --from shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples --subfolder axum/qdrant
```

## Usage

<Note>**IMPORTANT:** Currently Shuttle isn't able to provision a Qdrant Cloud cluster for you (yet). This means you will have to create an account on their [website](https://qdrant.tech/) and follow the few steps required to create a cluster and an API key to access it.</Note>

Add `shuttle-qdrant` and `qdrant-client` to the dependencies for your service by running `cargo add shuttle-qdrant qdrant-client@1.7.0`. This resource will be provided by adding the `shuttle_qdrant::Qdrant` attribute to your Shuttle main function.

It returns a `qdrant_client::QdrantClient`. When running locally it will by default spin up a Qdrant Docker container for your project.

If you want to connect to a remote database when running locally, you can specify the `local_url` parameter.

### Parameters

| Parameter  | Type   | Required? | Description |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- | ----------- |
| cloud_url  | &str   | In deployment | URL of the database to connect to. NOTE: It should use the gRPC port. |
| api_key    | &str   | No | Required if the database requires an API key. |
| local_addr | &str   | No | If specified, connect to this URL on local runs instead of using a Docker container. |

<Warning>Make sure the `cloud_url` parameter is specifying the gRPC port of the database. This is typically done by adding `:6334` at the end.</Warning>

You can use secrets interpolation to set the URL and API key. See below for an example.

### Example

In the case of an Axum server, your main function can look like this:

```rust
use qdrant_client::prelude::*;

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn axum(
    #[shuttle_qdrant::Qdrant(cloud_url = "{secrets.CLOUD_URL}", api_key = "{secrets.API_KEY}")]
    qdrant: QdrantClient,
) -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    // set up state and router...
}
```
