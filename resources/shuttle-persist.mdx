<Warning>The long-term goal is to deprecate and replace Shuttle Persist with more sophisticated key-value or blob storage solutions. When that happens, migrating saved Persist data to the new services will be possible.</Warning>

The persist plugin allows anything that implements `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize` to be persisted in a key-value store on the filesystem, and persist between deployments. This is useful for saving and retrieving data when it is not desired to hard code that data into the app. An example is saved settings for a Discord bot that need to remain the same between updates. State data, used in web frameworks such as Axum and Rocket, is also a good candidate for use of the persist plugin.

## Usage

To use the persist plugin, add `shuttle-persist` to the dependencies of your service with `cargo add shuttle-persist`. Then, annotate your `shuttle_runtime::main` function by adding the `shuttle-persist::Persist` attribute as a parameter. This will give a `PersistInstance`. The methods available are:

- `save()`: saves a key-value pair
- `load()`: loads the value stored in a key
- `remove()`: deletes a key
- `list()`: returns all the keys as a vector of strings
- `clear()`: deletes all keys

## Example

This snippet shows a Shuttle rocket main function that uses the `shuttle_persist::Persist` attribute to provision and get access to a `PersistInstance`. In this example, the `PersistInstance` is used to store state for the app.

```rust main.rs
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn rocket(
    #[shuttle_persist::Persist] persist: PersistInstance,
) -> ShuttleRocket {
    let state = MyState { persist };
    let rocket = rocket::build()
        .mount("/", routes![retrieve, add])
        .manage(state);

    Ok(rocket.into())
}
```
