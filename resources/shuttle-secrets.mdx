This plugin manages secrets on [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs).

## Usage

Add a `Secrets.toml` to the crate root or workspace root of your Shuttle service with the secrets you'd like to store.
Make sure to add `Secrets*.toml` to a `.gitignore` to omit your secrets from version control.

The format of the Secrets.toml file is a key-value mapping with string values.

```toml
MY_API_KEY = 'the contents of my API key'
MY_OTHER_SECRET = 'some other secret'
```

Next, pass `#[shuttle_runtime::Secrets] secrets: shuttle_runtime::SecretStore` as an argument to your `shuttle_runtime::main` function.
`SecretStore::get` can now be called to retrieve your API keys and other secrets at runtime.

## Local secrets

When developing locally with `cargo shuttle run`, you can use a different set of secrets by adding a `Secrets.dev.toml` file.

If you don't have a `Secrets.dev.toml` file, `Secrets.toml` will be used locally as well as for deployments.
If you want to have both secret files with some of the same secrets for both local runs and deployments, you have to duplicate the secret across both files.

## Different secrets file

You can also use other secrets files (in TOML format) by using the `--secrets [file]` argument on the `run` and `deploy` commands.

When deploying with the `--secrets` arg, that file is renamed to `Secrets.toml` before being packed and sent to Shuttle. Therefore, it has to be in the same folder that a normal `Secrets.toml` file would have been placed.

## Example

This snippet shows a Shuttle rocket main function that uses the `shuttle_runtime::Secrets` attribute to gain access to a `SecretStore`.

```rust main.rs
use shuttle_runtime::SecretStore;

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn rocket(
    #[shuttle_runtime::Secrets] secrets: SecretStore,
) -> shuttle_rocket::ShuttleRocket {
    // get secret defined in `Secrets.toml` file.
    let secret = secrets.get("MY_API_KEY").context("secret was not found")?;

    let state = MyState { secret };
    let rocket = rocket::build().mount("/", routes![secret]).manage(state);

    Ok(rocket.into())
}
```

The full example can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples/tree/main/rocket/secrets)

## Deleting secrets

This command will delete *all* secrets from your project.
Re-deploy with an updated `Secrets.toml` to add them back.

```bash
cargo shuttle resource delete secrets
```

## Caveats

- Some libraries read from their own config files or environment variables,
  with no way of providing them in code. Sometimes, this can be solved by
  manually setting the variable after loading the secret (and before loading the library):
  `std::env::set_var("SOME_ENV_VAR", my_secret);`
