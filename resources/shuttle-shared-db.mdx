This plugin manages databases on [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs) and connects them to your app.
A shared database is in the same cluster as other user's databases, but it is not accessible by other users.

If you want a high performing and isolated database, consider [Shuttle AWS RDS](./shuttle-aws-rds).

<Tip>You can connect to any type of remotely hosted database from your code, so do not let our current database offerings limit your creativity! Got other databases you want to see on Shuttle? Let us know!</Tip>

## Usage

Start by adding `shuttle-shared-db` to the dependencies for your service.
Each type of shareable database is behind its own feature flag and macro attribute path.

| Engine   | Feature flag | Attribute path |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Postgres | `postgres`   | `shuttle_shared_db::Postgres` |
| MongoDB  | `mongodb`    | `shuttle_shared_db::MongoDb`  |

### Output type

By default, you can get the connection string to the database and connect to it with your preferred library.
You can also specify other return types to get rid of common boilerplate.

Depending on which type declaration is used as the output type in the macro, you might need to activate additional feature flags:

| Engine   | Feature flag | Type declaration | Description |
|----------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| Postgres | | `String` | The connection string including username and password |
| Postgres | `sqlx` (with rustls) or `sqlx-native-tls` | `sqlx::PgPool` | An sqlx connection pool with reasonable defaults |
| Postgres | `diesel-async` | `diesel_async::AsyncPgConnection` | An async diesel connection with reasonable defaults |
| Postgres | `diesel-async-bb8` | `diesel_bb8::Pool<diesel_async::AsyncPgConnection>` | A bb8 connection pool with reasonable defaults |
| Postgres | `diesel-async-deadpool` | `diesel_deadpool::Pool<diesel_async::AsyncPgConnection>` | A deadpool connection pool with reasonable defaults |
| MongoDB  | | `String` | The connection string including username and password |
| MongoDB  | | `mongodb::Database` | A client pool connected to the database |

Lastly, add a macro annotaion to the Shuttle main function. Here are examples for Postgres:

```rust
// Use the connection string
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(#[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] conn_str: String) -> ... { ... }

// With sqlx feature flag, get a PgPool connected automatically
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(#[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] pool: sqlx::PgPool) -> ... { ... }
```

### Parameters

Both the Postgres and MongoDB macros take the same optional parameter:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| local_uri | &str | If specified, on local runs, use this database instead of starting a Docker container for it |

When passing in strings, you can also insert secrets from `Secrets.toml` using string interpolation.
To insert the `PASSWORD` secret, pass it in like this:

```rust
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(
    #[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres(
        local_uri = "postgres://postgres:{secrets.PASSWORD}@localhost:16695/postgres"
    )] conn_str: String,
) -> ... { ... }
```

<Note>Caveat: If you are interpolating a secret from `Secrets.dev.toml`, you need to set the same secret in `Secrets.toml` to a empty string so that this step does not crash in deployment.</Note>

The URI should be formatted according to the
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) or
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/)
documentation, depending on which one you're using.

If you do not specify a `local_uri`, then cargo-shuttle will attempt to spin up a Docker container and launch the database inside of it.
For this to succeed, you must have Docker installed and you must also have started the Docker engine. If you have not used Docker
before, the easiest way is to [install the desktop app](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and then launch it in order to start
the Docker engine.

## Example

The Shuttle main function below uses the `#[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres]` attribute macro to provision a shared Postgres database,
which can be accessed with an [sqlx Pool](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/pool/index.html).

```rust main.rs
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(
    #[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] pool: PgPool,
) -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    sqlx::migrate!()
        .run(&pool)
        .await
        .expect("Failed to run migrations");

    let state = MyState { pool };
    let router = Router::new()
        .route("/todos", post(add))
        .route("/todos/:id", get(retrieve))
        .with_state(state);

    Ok(router.into())
}
```
