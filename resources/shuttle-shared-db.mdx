title: "Shuttle Shared Databases"
---

This plugin manages databases on [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs) and connects them to your app. A shared database
will be on the same cluster as other user's databases, but it will not be accessible by other users.

If you want a high performing and isolated database, consider [Shuttle AWS RDS](./shuttle-aws-rds).

<Tip>You can connect to any type of remotely hosted database you want from your code, so do not let our current database offerings limit your creativity! Got other databases you want to see on Shuttle? Let us know!</Tip>

## Usage
Add `shuttle-shared-db` to the dependencies for your service.
Each type of database is behind the following feature flag and attribute path. `*-rustls` feature enables `rustls`-based implementation, otherwise some flavour of `native-tls` is used.

| Engine   | Feature flags | Attribute path | Return type |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Postgres | `postgres` or `postgres-rustls` | `shuttle_shared_db::Postgres` | `sqlx::PgPool` |
| MongoDB  | `mongodb` (uses rustls) | `shuttle_shared_db::MongoDb` | `mongodb::Database` |

### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| local_uri | str  | `None`  | If specified, on local runs, connect to this database instead of starting a Docker container for it. |

When setting the `local_uri` you can also insert secrets from `Secrets.toml` using string interpolation. To insert the
`PASSWORD` secret, pass it in like this:

```rust
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn poem(
    #[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres(
        local_uri = "postgres://postgres:{secrets.PASSWORD}@localhost:16695/postgres"
    )] pool: PgPool,
) -> ShuttlePoem<impl poem::Endpoint> { ... }
```

<Note>If you are interpolating a secret from `Secrets.dev.toml`, you need to set the same secret in `Secrets.toml` to a empty string so that this step does not crash in deployment.</Note>

The URI should be formatted according to the
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) or
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/)
documentation, depending on which one you're using.

If you do not specify a `local_uri`, then cargo-shuttle will attempt to spin up a Docker container and launch the database inside of it.
For this to succeed, you must have Docker installed and you must also have started the Docker engine. If you have not used Docker
before, the easiest way is to [install the desktop app](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and then launch it in order to start
the Docker engine.

## Example

The Shuttle poem main function below uses the `[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres]` attribute macro to provision a shared postgres database,
which can be accessed using a pre-configured, authenticated [sqlx Pool](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/pool/index.html).

```rust main.rs
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn poem(
    #[shuttle_shared_db::Postgres] pool: PgPool,
) -> ShuttlePoem<impl poem::Endpoint> {
    pool.execute(include_str!("../schema.sql"))
        .await
        .map_err(CustomError::new)?;

    let app = Route::new()
        .at("/todo", post(add))
        .at("/todo/:id", get(retrieve))
        .with(AddData::new(pool));

    Ok(app.into())
}
```
