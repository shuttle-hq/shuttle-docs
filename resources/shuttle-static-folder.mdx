title: 'Shuttle Static Folder'
---

This plugin allows services to get the path to a static folder at runtime, enabling the serving of static files such as web pages.

## Usage

Add `shuttle-static-folder` to the dependencies for your service. This resource can be utilized by adding a parameter to the main function and annoting it with the `shuttle_static_folder::StaticFolder` attribute, to get a `PathBuf` with the location of the static folder.

Here is a code snippet to illustrate::

```rust
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(
    #[shuttle_static_folder::StaticFolder] static_folder: PathBuf,
) -> __ { ... }
```

A `PathBuf` is an owned, mutable path (similar to a String). To know more about `PathBuf`, head over to the [discussion](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.PathBuf.html) in [The Rust Standard Library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html). By default, the folder is called `static`, unless specifically renamed (see below).

> Note: if you use `shuttle-static-folder` in your project and your project is a workspace, the static assets
> folder needs to be in the root of the workspace.

## Customization

The folder parameter name can be customized in order to change the name of the static folder.

| Parameter | Type | Default  | Description                                                                                |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| folder    | str  | `static` | The relative path, from the crate root, to the directory containing static files to deploy |

### Customization Example: Static Folder Renamed to Public Folder

The plugin defaults to a folder name of `static`, but there is freedom to change it. When annotating the parameter name, as noted above, add an argument in the format `folder = "<desired name>"`, as follows:

```rust
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn main(
    #[shuttle_static_folder::StaticFolder(folder = "public")] public_folder: PathBuf,
) -> __ { ... }
```

The parameter name should be changed to match, in this case being `folder = "public"`.

## Caveats

### Static folders in .gitignore

If you happen to be including your static folder in a `.gitignore` file, you will probably hit an error while trying to deploy your Shuttle app.

Shuttle is using the [ignore](https://crates.io/crates/ignore) crate under the hood, and it will ignore all the files and folders included in your `.gitignore` file. This means that the static folder will not be included in the final archive.

Take into account that this will only affect you if you are using the `shuttle deploy` command. If you are using the `shuttle run` command, you will not have any problems.

If you want to overcome this issue, you'll have to add a `.ignore` file to your project and include your static folder in it. The `.ignore` file takes precedence over the `.gitignore` file, so the static folder will be included in the final archive but will be still ignored by git.

For example, if you have a `.gitignore` file like this:

```gitignore
dist/
static/
target/
```

Then, in order to include the static folder in the final archive, you'll have to create a `.ignore` file like this:

```ignore
!static/
```

The team is working on a simpler solution for this scenario, but for now this work-around is needed.

### Working with a workspace

If you are working with a workspace, and depending on the structure of your workspace members you may stumble upon a problem when trying to deploy your Shuttle app.

Imagine you have a workspace like this:

```text
├── api            # Rust API code
├── front          # Dioxus front-end code
├── shared         # Shared code between the API and the front-end
└── Cargo.toml
```

And you have a process that will generate a static folder called `static` in the `front` member of the workspace.

Now, you have to think about two different scenarios:

1. You are using the `shuttle run` command to run your app locally.
1. You are using the `shuttle deploy` command to deploy your app to the cloud.

The problem is that, in the **first scenario**, the static folder should be in the **`api` member of the workspace**, but in the **second scenario**, the static folder should be in the **root of the workspace**.

So, the solution is to generate the static folder in the right place depending on the scenario you need to support.

The team is also working on a solution for this issue to make this behaviour consistent in both scenarios.
