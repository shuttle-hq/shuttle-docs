{/* TODO: Remove this page when it has aged a bit */}

`shuttle-static-folder` has been deprecated.
Deployed files are now located where you expect them to be.
Now, you can simply use the path relative to the workspace root.

```rust
#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn axum() -> shuttle_axum::ShuttleAxum {
    let router = Router::new()
        .nest_service("/assets", ServeDir::new("assets"));
    // ...
}
```
