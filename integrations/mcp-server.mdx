Take your Vibe Coding of Shuttle apps to the next level with an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server!

## Set up local MCP wrapper

Shuttle Docs uses [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/), who provides an easy way to run a local MCP server.
Make sure to have Node.js installed.

```sh
npx mint-mcp add shuttle
```

The command above will show you a command such as `node /home/user/.mcp/shuttle/src/index.js` for running the MCP server.

## Add to Cursor

To use the MCP server in [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) ([docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)), adapt the command from the previous step and add it to Cursor's config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shuttle": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/home/user/.mcp/shuttle/src/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

If it works, you should be able to ask the Cursor agent about Shuttle and get some better answers.
