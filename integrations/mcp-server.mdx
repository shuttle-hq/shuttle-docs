To make Rust development even better, we've built the Shuttle MCP server.

The Shuttle [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) brings our entire documentation and tooling ecosystem directly into your favorite AI coding assistant. Think of it as having a Shuttle expert sitting right next to you while you code.

## What's this for?

The Shuttle MCP server supercharges your development workflow in two powerful ways:

**Contextual Knowledge**: It acts as a bridge between Shuttle's comprehensive documentation and your AI coding assistant, providing instant access to Shuttle-specific guidance without leaving your editor. No more tab-switching between docs and code!

**Powerful Development Tools**: Beyond just documentation, the MCP server gives your AI agent direct access to Shuttle's tooling ecosystem. Your assistant can help you deploy services, fetch logs, manage resources, and interact with the Shuttle console - all through natural conversation. This makes Shuttle development significantly faster and more intuitive.

## Installation

The Shuttle MCP server comes with the Shuttle CLI, make sure you have the [Shuttle CLI](https://docs.shuttle.dev/getting-started/installation) installed first.

## Configuration

Choose your preferred AI coding environment and add the Shuttle MCP server configuration.

## You're all set! ðŸš€

Your AI coding assistant now has direct access to Shuttle's knowledge base and tooling. Whether you're deploying services, managing resources, or troubleshooting issues, your AI companion can provide contextual, accurate guidance powered by the official Shuttle documentation.

The integration works seamlessly in the background - just code naturally and let your AI assistant tap into Shuttle's expertise when needed. Happy coding!
