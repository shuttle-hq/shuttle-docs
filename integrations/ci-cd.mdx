  Connecting your GitHub account via the [GitHub
  integration](/integrations/github) is easier and simpler for automatic
  deployments. However, if your deployment requires building other static assets
  like React or Vue builds, you'll need to set up a custom GitHub Action and run
  the build script first before deploying to Shuttle.

## Which Should I Use?

| Your Project                                  | Use This               |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Pure Rust backend (Axum, Actix, Rocket)       | **GitHub Integration** |
| Rust + pre-built static files commited to git | **GitHub Integration** |
| Rust + React/Vue build step                   | **GitHub Actions**     |
| Rust + Asset compilation (SCSS, Tailwind)     | **GitHub Actions**     |
| Rust + Code generation before deploy          | **GitHub Actions**     |

Shuttle provides a GitHub Action for automating deployments. This action can run the `shuttle deploy` command for you, enabling continuous deployments on every push.

Here's an example of a GitHub Actions workflow that uses the Shuttle Deploy Action:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Shuttle

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: shuttle-hq/deploy-action@v2
        with:
          shuttle-api-key: ${{ secrets.SHUTTLE_API_KEY }}
          project-id: proj_0123456789
          secrets: |
            MY_AWESOME_SECRET_1 = '${{ secrets.SECRET_1 }}'
```

## Inputs

| Name                  | Description                                | Required | Default       |
