### Tutorial Structure:

1. Learning Objectives (Shuttle’s features/concepts) and what we’re building
   1. introduce bullet points of Shuttle-specific concepts we will be covering/explaining in this tutorial (with links to relevant sections)
2. Prerequisites
   1. estimated completion time
   2. accounts needed
   3. installed tools needed
   4. rust
3. What we’re building
   1. this section starts with 1-2 lines on what we are building and a concise top level design of the app, so the user understands at a very high-level what this app will look like (don’t go into too much detail)
4. Tutorial (in steps)
   1. Each step needs a clear, concise yet comprehensive explanation
   2. A separate explanation of Shuttle-specific concepts, as they are introduced in steps
5. What you’ve learned (key Shuttle concepts) section
6. Optional troubleshooting sections for common issues users might encounter
7. Next steps (suggestions for what the user can do next) [optional]
8. Link to a GH repo with the full code of the E2E tutorial

### Guidelines

1. Tutorials are end-to-end walkthroughs - as opposed to how-to guides for specific features/problems
2. There should logical progression between tutorials
3. There should not be too many tutorials - only enough to cover the main Shuttle concepts and teach the user about those concepts in progressive level of complexity - from simplest to most advanced ones
4. Tutorials should be called after the concepts they are focused on - rather than referring to examples they cover (e.g. rather than “URL Shortener” use something like “Building an App with PostgreSQL”)
5. If a tutorial doesn’t cover any Shuttle-specific concepts/features or all of those concepts have already been covered in other tutorials it should not be added.
6. Tutorials should provide a complete working example that users can build upon
7. Use code comments extensively to explain what each part of the code does
8. Keep tutorials focused on practical applications rather than contrived examples
9. Each tutorial needs to have E2E code repo for that tutorial linked to
10. If something has a frontend, minimise or make that code as concise as possible
11. Avoid huge code blocks - if they are needed, then try to split them into parts
