{/*
All new accounts created on or after **May 19th, 2025** are automatically enrolled in a **14-day Pro Trial**.

This gives you access to most **Pro-tier features** without needing to enter payment details upfront. It’s a chance to explore the full potential of Shuttle before deciding whether to upgrade.

### **What’s included**

During your Pro Trial, you can:

- Deploy up to **3 projects on [Reserved Instances](https://docs.shuttle.dev/pricing/faq#instance-types)**
- Configure up to **3 custom domains**
- Access **project-level telemetry exports**
- Enjoy increased limits and performance compared to the Community tier

### **What happens after the trial?**

After 14 days, your account will **automatically downgrade to the Community plan** unless you choose to upgrade.

- All projects will be stopped at downgrade
- You can deploy 1 project at a time, as per the Community tier limit

You’ll receive in-console reminders and emails about how much time you have left and what changes to expect post-trial.

You can upgrade to Pro anytime from the [Billing page](https://console.shuttle.rs/account/billing)
