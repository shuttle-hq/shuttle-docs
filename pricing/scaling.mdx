When scaling your application on Shuttle, you have two main options for increasing computational resources:

- **Vertical scaling:** Increase the vCPU and memory of your existing project(s). This is ideal when you need more power for individual applications. Available to both Pro and Growth.
- **Horizontal scaling:** Deploy replicas of your application to distribute load and increase availability. Available exclusively to Growth tier.

Both options are billed as detailed in the sections below:

## Vertical scaling

Simply upgrade your instance size and pay the difference. Each instance size comes with a base amount of included vCPU (0.25 vCPU), and you only pay for the additional (billable) vCPU usage per hour.

| Instance Size | vCPU | Memory (GB) | Included vCPU | Billable vCPU |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Basic** | 0.25 | 512 | 0.25 | 0 |
| **Small** | 0.5 | 1 | 0.25 | 0.25 |
| **Medium** | 1 | 2 | 0.25 | 0.75 |
| **Large** | 2 | 4 | 0.25 | 1.75 |
| **X Large** | 4 | 8 | 0.25 | 3.75 |
| **XX Large** | 8 | 16 | 0.25 | 7.75 |

*For example, if you upgrade from Basic (0.25 vCPU) to Medium (1 vCPU), you'll only be charged for the additional 0.75 vCPU since 0.25 vCPU is included in your plan.*

## Horizontal scaling

Growth tier users can configure a single project to run on multiple instances and have Shuttle seamlessly load balance traffic across them for higher scalability and availability. Each replica instance is billed based on its instance size and vCPU usage per hour.

## Purchase additional projects

Pro, Growth and Enterprise users can purchase additional projects beyond their included projects. The minimum instance for each additional project is 0.5 vCPU and is billed according to the table below.

| Instance Size | vCPU | Memory GB | Included vCPU | Billable vCPU |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Small** | 0.5 | 1 | 0 | 0.5 |
| **Medium** | 1 | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| **Large** | 2 | 3 | 0 | 2 |
| **X Large** | 4 | 8 | 0 | 4 |
| **XX Large** | 8 | 16 | 0 | 8 |

*Note: The vCPU allocations for additional projects do not include any "included vCPU" - you'll be billed for the full vCPU amount of the instance size you select.*

### How many additional projects can you add on each tier?

| Tier | Included projects | Additional projects | Total project limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Community** | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| **Pro** | 3 | 7 | 10 |
| **Growth** | 10 | 40 | 50 |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Custom |

## Request Rate Guidelines

Shuttle provides flexible request rate guidelines to ensure optimal performance for all users and projects across our tiers. These guidelines help you determine which tier best suits your application's needs:

- **Community**: Up to 10 requests per second
- **Pro**: Up to 50 requests per second
- **Growth**: Up to 1,000 requests per second

These limits are not strictly enforced as hard caps but serve as performance guidance. Applications may experience performance degradation when consistently exceeding the recommended request rates for their tier.

If your application regularly exceeds the recommended request rate for your current tier, our team may reach out to suggest an upgrade to a more suitable tier. This helps ensure your application maintains optimal performance and doesn't impact the overall platform experience.
