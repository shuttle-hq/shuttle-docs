## Choosing a Plan

Shuttle offers four distinct tiers designed to support developers and teams at every stage of their journey. Here's a detailed guide to help you choose the right plan for your needs.

### Community

The Community tier is free and perfect for getting started with Shuttle. It provides the core features needed for learning Rust, building personal projects, or experimenting with new ideas. You get one project with essential compute resources, a starter database, and custom domain supportâ€”everything needed to build and deploy hobby applications or proof-of-concepts.

### Pro

When you're ready to move your applications to production, the Pro tier provides the reliability and support you need. It includes three projects running on reserved instances, enhanced monitoring capabilities, and guaranteed support response times. This tier is ideal for individual developers or small teams running production workloads that require consistent performance and professional support.

### Growth

The Growth tier supports teams running complex production applications that need advanced scaling capabilities. It includes team collaboration features, auto-scaling and zero-downtime deployments. With dedicated databases and priority support, the Growth tier is designed for organizations that need robust infrastructure and team-focused features to support their growing applications.

### Enterprise

The Enterprise tier provides customizable infrastructure solutions for larger organizations with specific requirements. It offers single-tenant deployments, custom hardware configurations, multi-region support, and advanced security features. This tier is suitable for organizations that need complete control over their infrastructure, have specific compliance requirements, or require custom support agreements.
