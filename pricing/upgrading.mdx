## Community to Pro

When upgrading from Community to Pro tier, you'll need to redeploy your application to move from a spot instance to a reserved instance. This is a simple process:

1. Upgrade your account to Pro tier
2. Redeploy your existing application using the [Shuttle CLI](/guides/cli#commands) or Console
3. Your application will automatically be moved to a reserved instance with guaranteed resources
