Each Shuttle plan includes a base subscription with predetermined resource allocations. Additional resources can be purchased as needed, giving you the flexibility to scale your applications while maintaining cost control.

## How Billing Works

Your monthly bill consists of your base plan subscription plus any additional resource usage beyond the included allocations from the previous month. Pro and Growth tiers start with a 14-day free trial of the base subscription. Usage charges still apply during the trial period.

*Note: The Growth tier free trial cannot be used if you have already used the Pro tier free trial.*

## Usage-based Pricing

Additional resources beyond your plan's included limits are billed at the rates shown below.

| Additional Resource | Rate | Available to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database Storage | $0.12/GB/month | Pro and Growth |
| Build Minutes | $0.025/minute | Pro and Growth |
| Network Egress | $0.10/GB | Pro and Growth |
| Custom Domains | $0.25/domain/month | Pro and Growth |
| Compute (vCPU) | $0.06/vCPU hour | Pro and Growth |
| Dedicated Database | $20/month | Pro and Growth |
| Team Member | $25/user/month | Growth |

*For example, if your plan includes 1GB of network egress and you use 1.5GB, you'll be billed for the extra 0.5GB at $0.10/GB.*
